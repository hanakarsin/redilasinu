She underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2017, and since then, has lost a ton of weight. Although Mila was born in Brazil, she lived in Boston. Now, those who followed her journey are in mourning following the news of her death at just 35 years old.</p><p>While many of Mila's fans want to learn more about exactly what happened to her, others are wondering who her family was, and in particular, her husband. Keep reading for all of the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@miladejesusoficial</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Mila de Jesus's husband?</h2><p>Mila's death in January 2024 came just four months after she married her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Kowszik</a>. George isn't a public person in the same way his wife was, and his Instagram contains only a single photo of the two of them embracing one another. Fans have written kind notes under the post, offering their own thoughts about Mila and telling George how sorry they are for his loss.</p><p>George is slightly more active on Facebook, though, where his bio suggests that he is the "President of Wall Systems Unlimited LLC" as well as a "Life Transitional Coach and Business Coach." George first announced Mila's death on Facebook.</p><p>"I am not really good with words and talking here," he wrote. "I lost my beautiful wife and my best friend yesterday that I love so much for her. I don't know what to say."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Did Mila de Jesus have kids?</h2><p>Mila and George didn't have any children together, but Mila had four children from a previous marriage. Those children ranged in age, but one of her older children, Anna Clara, posted a note on her mother's Instagram page asking for continued prayers for the family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by üåüMila De Jesus (@miladejesusoficial)</a></p></figure><p>Mila also had at least one younger son who appeared frequently across her social media accounts, but her older children appeared much more sporadically. Now, the entire family is in mourning, and is receiving condolences both from those who knew Mila personally and from those who followed her on social media.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What was Mila de Jesus's cause of death?</h2><p>Although Mila's cause of death hasn't been publicly announced by her family, reports from local news outlets suggest that she collapsed as the result of a heart attack.</p><p>Mila announced in October 2023 that she was suffering from psoriasis, an itchy skin condition that results in causes rashes across the body. Mila said at the time that she had been suffering from the condition since July, although it isn't clear whether that had anything to do with her death.</p><p>In November, Mila commemorated six years since she underwent her gastric bypass surgery by posting a comparison of her before her weight loss and what she looked like more recently. ‚ÄúSix years since a decision that changed my life in various aspects,‚Äù she wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúOn one side, the 22-year-old Mila, and on the other, the 35-year-old Mila.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforatrYydnGailajCtHnHrqqbmZ6Z</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nnamdi-kanu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Nnamdi Kanu, A Champion Of Truth, Justice Like Mandela'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vhong-navarro-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Vhong Navarro - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
