Over the years, socialite and model <a href=#>Lori Harvey</a> has made headlines due to her romantic life and her ability to maintain her mystique.</p><p>Not to mention, female celebrities constantly find themselves on baby watch, especially if they’ve been in a long-term relationship or recently jumped the broom. That said, Disney darling <a href=#>Halle Bailey</a> is the latest celeb to be make headlines with baby news. Here's everything we know so far about <a href=#>Halle and DDG</a>'s first child, Halo.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Halle Bailey hid her pregnancy well, until her son Halo was born around the start of 2024.</h2><p>Baby rumors concerning Halle and her boyfriend DDG began running rampant online in mid-August. In case you’ve been out of the loop, this was all due to an Aug. 19, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MediaTakeOut</a> article.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per the outlet, three entertainment industry professionals shared their suspicions about the actor being with child. The sources think that in Halle’s social media posts from early July 2023 to mid-August 2023, the star didn't show her stomach. They thought that she might have been hiding a pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some of the photos showed Halle posing with her back to the camera or wearing baggy clothes. So, sources immediately thought that she was hiding a baby bump.</p><p>Interestingly, Halle responded to the rumors by posting a slew of videos and photos that made it seem as though she wasn't with child.</p><p>However, social media posts of Halle shared by fans via TikTok didn't help the allegations.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>An Aug. 20, 2023, TikTok video posted by Flynn West (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@flynnwest</a>) shows a video of DDG apparently on live eating a snack as someone plays an instrument in the background. Interestingly, a woman wearing baggy clothes — who appears to look like Halle — walks in the camera view in the background. In the short clip, the woman appears to be holding her belly area that looks rather round, like a pregnancy belly.</p><p>Another TikTok video shared by Moneytear (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@themoneytea</a>) shows Halle and Chloe taking a video with a fan. In the video, Halle is seen wearing a loose-fitting pink dress, which many call a maternity outfit.</p><p>As a result, social media was relentless with their belief that Halle was indeed with child.</p><p>"Halle Bailey getting pregnant at the peak of her career by a man who admits his jealousy towards her is no coincidence on his part," one person wrote in a now-deleted tweet on Sept. 14, 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, it seems as though the internet was right as Halle revealed she had a son, Halo, sometime around the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024. In a Jan. 7, 2024 Instagram post, Halle writes, "Even though we’re a few days into the new year, the greatest thing that 2023 could have done for me, was bring me my son.. welcome to the world my halo the world is desperate to know you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Halle Bailey’s sister Chloe Bailey was quick to clap back back at sources talking about a possible pregnancy.</h2><p>One thing you can always count on the Bailey sisters to do is to step behind each other for any and everything. After pregnancy rumors about Halle went into overdrive on social media, <a href=#>Chloe</a> decided to send folks a message about leaving her sister alone in an Instagram Live session during the Aug. 18, 2023, weekend.</p><p>“Y’all better keep my sister’s name out of your mouth. Thank you,” Chloe said while getting her hair styled via 9MagTV “Amen, hallelujah. About to get me riled the hell up. Anyways.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Fans quickly praised Chloe for standing up for her sister amid the rumors circulating online. In fact, many fans noted that the sisters have a history of standing up for each other amid any type of backlash.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If we go back to July 2021, Chloe started facing backlash for embracing her sex appeal and teasing solo music. Halle quickly stood up for her sister against a Twitter user with a cute threat to put the person in their place.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, of course, no one is surprised that Chloe kept the same energy when Halle was being attacked.</p><p>That said, ever since the rumors began spreading like wildfire, Halle never issued a statement to confirm or deny the speculation. In fact, she never publicly acknowledged Chloe’s show of solidarity.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paparazzi's October 2023 pictures of Halle Bailey had social media convinced she was pregnant.</h2><p>In a viral post on The Shade Room's Instagram account, we see Halle out with boyfriend DDG. Not only was the Little Mermaid star dressed for comfort, but it was clear there was some roundness to her belly.</p><p>Social media seemed to be in agreement as most of the comments centered around the pregnancy rumors being true. One person wrote, "I tried not to believe the rumors," while another pointed out, "These men love knocking women up in the height of their careers. I hope she doesn’t end up a single mom she seems so sweet smh."</p><p>While Halle managed to keep her pregnancy under wraps the entire time, the cat is out of the bag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButMClo55lkpa2rbHYZqernZejrq%2FA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./247167-mawaziri-wawili-ambao-marehemu-biwott-alikuwa-amepanga-kukutana-nao-kabla-ya-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mawaziri wawili ambao marehemu Biwott alikuwa amepanga kukutana nao kabla ya kufariki ghafla</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greg-wise-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greg Wise - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
