Now, as the coronavirus pandemic shuts down much of America, the singer is doing everything she can to raise people’s spirits and help those who have been impacted by the crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it’s an inspirational video on Instagram or a more tangible contribution, Dolly has proven she’s the mother-figure we need to get through this.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dolly Parton recently donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University.</h2><p>In addition to boosting our morale, Dolly is also doing everything she can to ensure that scientists have the tools they need to learn more about the virus. In that spirit, <a href=#>the singer recently donated $1 million</a> to Vanderbilt University.</p><p>“My longtime friend Dr. Naji Abumrad, who’s been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards research of the coronavirus for a cure,” Parton said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The singer continued by announcing her donation. “I am making a donation of $1 million to Vanderbilt towards that research and to encourage people that can afford it to make donations,” she wrote. Naji is a professor of surgery at Vanderbilt, and his son, Jad Abumrad, has successfully parlayed his father’s relationship with Dolly into a podcast called Dolly Parton’s America.</p><p>Dolly also recently announced that she would be hosting a weekly series designed to calm people’s nerves as much of America remains self-isolated from one another to fight the spread of the virus.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The series, called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodnight with Dolly</a>,” will feature the singer reading a bedtime story from her international book donation program Imagination Library. &nbsp;“I think it is pretty clear that now is the time to share a story and to share some love," she said when she announced the series.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How is Dolly Parton connected to Vanderbilt?</h2><p>In addition to her friendship with Naji, some have wondered whether Dolly chose to donate to Vanderbilt for another reason. While Dolly never attended the university, she does have a strong connection to it, in part because it is so close to her home in Nashville, Tenn. This isn’t the first time that Dolly has engaged with the Vanderbilt campus.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Dolly‘s niece was actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">honored</a> in a ceremony on the university’s campus for a Butterfly Garden that was opened in her name at the hospital near the campus. Dolly’s history with Vanderbilt stretches back years, and it seems that she understands what an important role the university plays in the community she calls home.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dolly’s quarantine videos are a ray of sunshine.</h2><p>In addition to reading everyone in the country a bedtime story, Dolly has also been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posting videos</a> of herself on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> in which she offers inspiring messages to those watching. In one video, she discussed the virus, and said that she believes that there’s still a light at the end of this tunnel.&nbsp;</p><p>“I'm not making light out of the situation. Well, maybe I am because it's the light, I believe, that's going to dissolve the situation. I think God is in this, I really do,” she said.</p><p>Dolly said that the pandemic may ultimately teach people a lesson. "I think he's trying to hold us up to the light so we can see ourselves and see each other through the eyes of love, and I hope we learn that lesson," she said. "I think that when this passes we're all gonna be better people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbytuNhmp5qqpKS7bsLAp5ueqpKeubU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./400753-chelsea-3-1-luton-town-abraham-scores-hat-trick-blues-qualify-5th-fa-cup-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chelsea 3-1 Luton Town: Abraham scores hat-trick as Blues qualify for 5th round of FA Cup</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./291232-goodluck-jonathan-administration-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thirty Achievements of Goodluck Jonathan Administration</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
