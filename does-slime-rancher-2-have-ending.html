Given that the game is still being developed, though, that does mean that there isn't an ending to the game... yet.</p><p>Though players won't be able to complete the campaign while the title is in early access, the developers have promised that it will "feel relatively whole and worth playing" — even if you can't work your way through the entire game from the get-go.</p><p>For now, players are expected to use the time that the game is in early access as a way to get familiar with the game's new world, making it easier for them to breeze through the campaign once it's fully released.</p><p>"Rainbow Island is an intricate place to explore, and discovering the best locations for resources, unlocking shortcuts and hidden paths, and learning where various slime types dwell will help your future adventures in Slime Rancher 2’s future updates," the game's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> page reads.</p><p>Since the game isn't complete though, you will eventually reach a point in the title where you can no longer venture further — but the developers insist there will still be plenty for you to do.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"Even in the initial release, Slime Rancher 2 is designed to be played as long as you like. Eventually, you will discover a point in the world where the game will obviously be expanded, but you are still free to continue to develop your Conservatory, build gadgets, and hunt down all the treasure pods," the developers wrote. "And when Slime Rancher 2 is updated, it should be a seamless continuation of your experience: you’ll simply have more to see and do, building upon what is already there."</p><p>When you run out of things to do, unfortunately, the only thing left is to put the game away until another update (or the full title) is released. At this time, though, there isn't an official release date for Slime Rancher 2. So, if you were hoping to play it all through from beginning to end, it may be worth waiting until the full launch.</p><p>That being said, whatever progress you make in early access will seamlessly transfer over once the game is out, so you won't lose your progress.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long is 'Slime Rancher 2'?</h2><p>Since there isn't a clear ending to the game just yet, it's impossible to say how long it will take to complete Slime Rancher 2 in its entirety — though it seems like the titles will feature plenty to keep you busy, regardless of your progress through the campaign.</p><p>The developers have already promised that early access players will receive numerous updates before the title's full launch, suggesting there will be plenty of hours' worth of quests and missions to complete before you reach its end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yso6KllWK%2ForrCoZyrZWJitaLCxGacp5yZo7Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-my-instagram-explore-page-reset.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Your Explore Page on Instagram Suddenly Reset Itself?
