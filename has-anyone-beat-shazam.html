Whether it's sitting at home when you're sick from school dreaming of the day you'd get to be on The Price Is Right or watching Quiz Show and muttering to yourself you'd never do what John Turturro's character did (I mean, he got the "Marty" answer wrong, seriously?), it's a wonderful fantasy to imagine yourself being at a high enough level to attain not only 15 minutes of fame but also a huge cash prize.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=#>Beat Shazam</a> is a popular game show. Has anyone ever won against the computer algorithm? In order to win, teams have to be faster that the computer algorithm. Very few teams have accomplished the feat. Keep reading for all the details.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has anyone ever won 'Beat Shazam' hosted by Nick Cannon?</h2><p>Yes! But it's a super rare occurrence. There are only three teams who have ever successfully toppled the song-recognizing algorithm in identifying a song.</p><p><a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a> and his daughter Corrine Foxx have stepped away from the show due to Jamie's health issues. In the meantime, <a href=#>Nick Cannon and Kelly Osbourne</a> are going to be the host and DJ on Beat Shazam.</p><p>If you aren't familiar with the show, here's how it works. You must accurately identify a song before Shazam software can do so.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The game increases with difficulty, and different teams are offered a series of four possible answers, with increasing cash prizes for each time they beat Shazam to naming the song. The team who gets the correct answer the fastest gets the cash prize, and if they tie another team, then they're both awarded the full amount of money.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The goal is to constantly beat Shazam until you accrue a whopping million-dollar prize. There haven't been many people who were able to accomplish this feat, but on June 22, 2017, Christina Porcelli and Steve Lester officially became the first team to ever get that fat $1 million payout.</p><p>To see the enthusiasm in Jamie Foxx's eyes (he was the host at the time) during the team's unprecedented run in real time was truly special.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The team was at an impasse. Do they accept the $197,000 that they had accrued and just walk away? They could, but they wouldn't get a shot at the million bucks. If they did decide to move forward and they got the answer wrong, they would have had that amount of money halved, leaving them with $98,500.</p><p>Jamie asked them if they wanted to beat Shazam or walk away, and Christina, without batting an eye, slaps her hands and says that she's going to beat Shazam. The crowd goes nuts and then the two proceed to test their mettle against Shazam, and it just so happens that the song was "Shout" by Tears for Fears.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The second team to win Beat Shazam had their crowning moment occur on June 26, 2018, when Donna Natosi and Ryan Walton made $207,000 and were forced with the same conundrum: Walk away with nearly a quarter million dollars, or get a shot at the whole kit and caboodle.</p><p>They went all the way.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The winning song? Well, if you lived in the Northeast and ever tuned into 106.7, then you'd know it instantly too: "Soak up the Sun" by Sheryl Crow.</p><p>Then on May 20, 2019, a Teacher's Special episode featured brothers Aaron and Martin Smith getting to the million-dollar song with $189,000 on the line. The song? "Found Out About You."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Their celebration was probably the best the show's ever seen, too. Be sure to tune into new episodes to see if any other teams manage to beat Shazam.</p><p>New episodes of Beat Shazam air on Fox on Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna60ecCnsKimlWKvpq3TZqqhmaqWug%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1235866-how-create-style-space-buns-tutorial-styling-ideas-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to create and style space buns: tutorial and styling ideas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harris-j-singer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harris J - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
