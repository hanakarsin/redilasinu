The on-again-off-again couple share three kids: Gannon, Jaxie, and Broncs.&nbsp;</p><p>Mackenzie and Josh have been married, filed for divorce, and engaged again, all within just a few years. In May of last year, it appeared to everyone that they ended their relationship for the final time, calling it quits, but the couple got back together and are living with their kids in Lakeland, Fla. However, this time, Mackenzie isn't getting backlash about her relationship with Josh, but she is being slammed by Teen Mom fans about making racist comments about <a href=#>Vice President Kamala Harris</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mackenzie (@mackenziemckee)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why do 'Teen Mom' fans want Mackenzie McKee fired?</h2><p>A Facebook post apparently posted by Mackenzie was shared, and made its way into a Teen Mom forum on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> that summarizes why she doesn‚Äôt feel that Vice President Harris was fit for her role. "Sorry, no. There are a lot of amazing women in the world for my daughters to look up to and see as role models. Kamala Harris is not one of them," part of Mackenzie's Facebook post reads. She then adds her own comments after a follower says that they agree with what she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>The person wrote, ‚ÄúI started reading the first paragraph, and I was like umm imma have to disagree. Then kept reading, and I‚Äôm like yep, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre friends.‚Äù Then Mackenzie commented back and said, ‚ÄúIt blows my mind that out of all the amazing colored women in this world, that is the one who is making history.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Fans are livid over the use of the word "colored" and now some Teen Mom OG fans are calling for her to be fired by MTV after her racist comments.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans of 'Teen Mom' instantly took to social media about Mackenzie's racist comments.</h2><p>After the Facebook post started circulating the internet, fans did not hesitate to call Mackenzie out about the racist comments she made towards Vice President Kamala Harris. On that same Teen Mom forum, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user says: "The fact she isn't on hot water with MTV is unreal."&nbsp;</p><p>Another person wrote: "Soooooo MTV producers do your thang and ditch this b----."&nbsp;</p><p>A third person chimed in: "It was one thing when my 90-something grandfather used this outdated term and I had to correct him ... but hoo boy this is an entirely different situation." Many fans began&nbsp;slamming Mackenzie left and right, calling her racist, ignorant, and dumb.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mackenzie apologized for her racist comments on social media.</h2><p>The Teen Mom OG star certainly took notice to all the backlash and decided it was time for her to speak up. Mackenzie&nbsp;apologized for her remarks via social media, as well as for making a bad choice by using the racist term "colored." She started her apology post on the Instagram page <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teenmomshaderoom</a> with, "I have been personally reaching out to those who were affected and hurt by my poor choice of words and lack of education on not knowing how wrong I was."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Destinyü•∞ (@teenmomshaderoom_)</a></p></figure><p>Mackenzie ended her message by writing, "But I won't make excuses for myself other than just admitting I was wrong. But truly in my heart I am sorry, I was wrong."</p><p>Not too long after the apology, fellow Teen Mom star Cheyenne Floyd took to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> account, and fans figured her tweet was directed towards Mackenzie. She wrote, "It‚Äôs time to have a conversation, a form, something to educate and enlighten because the ignorance is pervasive."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs time to have a conversation, a form, something to educate and enlighten because the ignorance is pervasive</p>‚Äî cheyennefloyd (@itskcheyenne) <a href=#>January 30, 2021</a></figure><p>This appears to not have been the first time that Mackenzie has shared racist comments. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopCulture</a>, The Hollywood Gossip reported that she referred to Native Americans as being both "lazy" and "welfare-dependent." In 2020, MTV severed ties with Taylor Selfridge (girlfriend of Cory Wharton) after racist tweets she posted resurfaced. We guess we will have to wait and see what happens to Mackenzie.</p><p>Teen Mom OG airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKmuoympqZlnZawrLHNs6CeZZ2YuKaxjKuYnKGjqXqku8ymnKesow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1095530-london-school-economic-denies-melaye-attended-institution-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>London School of Economic denies Melaye attended institution</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./weston-koury-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Weston Koury - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
