It was only announced all of a sudden by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jeff Probst</a> that Dan Spilo had been removed from the show and would not return to camp.</p><p class=align-left>The decision was, however, mutual because Spilo exited silently after a conversation with the show directors, and both parties opted to keep privacy and confidentiality intact.

What did Dan Spilo do? It was revealed that the reason behind Spilo’s exit is inappropriate conduct involving him touching a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">female producer’s thigh</a> as he was getting into a transport boat.</p><p class=align-left>This borders around sexual harassment, and for that reason alone, he had to be removed from the show to send a message that such behaviour is not condoned. In his defence, Dan claimed that the touch was accidental as he had been trying to regain his balance while the boat was moving.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What happened to Tila Tequila?

Here is his statement to the people:</p>Deeply sorry for how my actions affected Kellee during the taping of this season of Survivor. After apologizing at the tribal council when I first learned that Kellee still felt uncomfortable, I want to make sure I do so again, clearly and unambiguously. I truly regret that anyone was made to feel uncomfortable with my behavior. In my life, I have always tried to treat others with decency, integrity, and kindness. I can only hope that my actions in the future can help me to make amends and show me to be the kind of father, husband, colleague, and friend that I always aim to be, Dan said.<p class=align-left>Those unfortunate occurrences meant that Survivor Dan Spilo kicked off the show without being voted out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What happened to Dr. Brenda on The Incredible Dr. Pol?</p><h2>A pattern</h2><p class=align-left>Dan Spilo may have apologized, but most of the Survivor contestants argued that this repeated behaviour only showed a pattern. For instance, Kellee said had she been heard with regard to her allegation when the season was beginning, this pattern would not have occurred.</p><p class=align-left>This put doubt on Dan’s innocence because there's no way several women would accuse him if he was not doing something wrong. However, Dan Spilo did not entirely deny the allegations.</p><p class=align-left>He acknowledged that he might have done those actions unintentionally and not knowing but said what mattered is what his accusers said because that was their truth, and he was deeply sorry for it.

This prompted Survivor producers to initiate some changes to the series, including new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sexual harassment rules</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Other measures that were incorporated as a result include sensitivity and anti-bias training for all cast and contestants. This is to ensure that what happened to Dan Spilo on Survivor does not repeat itself.</p><p class=align-left>After what happened to Dan Spilo from Survivor, the 39th season of the show will be remembered for many years to come. Indeed, many crazy gameplays took place during that season, but they are all overshadowed by incidences of inappropriate touching by Dan Spilo. Was Dan Spilo falsely accused?
