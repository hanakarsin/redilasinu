If a person is deceived, he or she takes lie for truth. The concept of deception is logically opposed to the idea of truth, but at the same time, it can also be an unintended delusion, and ingenious falsification, pure hypocrisy, and the "truth" of the previous historical stage.</p><p class=align-left>We want to say that deception is always a deliberate action, and if a person lies unintentionally, he or she is also a liar. The concept of "lie" includes not only the perversiоn of the truth (the message of false information) but also the omission about anything significant (hiding the truth).</p><p class=align-left>Cheating, as a deliberate act, most often expresses selfish isolation, disruption of community, distrust, hostility towards others, or unauthentic communication, dominated by pragmatic goals.

Some scientists have divided the deception into separate categories depending on the destructiveness, the psychology of the liar, and its object.

However, they are selected to bring a person to the wrong conclusion.</p><p class=align-left>Failure and contextual lie are examples of misrepresentation. Generally, this type is too broad, since any form of deception contains an element of false representation.</p><h3>Juggling with facts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/efdd8fc0fe79eaab.png><p class=align-left>It is a special case of misrepresentation, which consists of the manipulation of qualitatively correct facts. They are presented in such a light that leads a listener to obviously wrong conclusions.</p><h3>Exaggeration</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/753395d8b5cf9de6.png><p class=align-left>It occurs if the statement is qualitatively true, but the given quantitative characteristics are embellished and do not correspond to reality.</p><h3>Understatement</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a083122b89588511.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is an inverse form to exaggeration, which means the data is qualitatively correct but quantitatively reduced.

An example of a joking lie is sarcasm. The question of whether such a trick is a "real" deception is often disputed, and many philosophers have different opinions about it.</p><p class=align-left>Lying is an ordinary, fundamental skill in the life of every person. It is believed that the development of the human brain occurred under the pressure of continuously increasing cognitive abilities to create and recognise deception.</p><p class=align-left>Lies permeate all spheres of human life and social interaction. Public messages regarding deception are often controversial. We teach children to lie successfully and make others lie to us, even though we regard lies as a vice. The development of comprehensive psychology of deception should take into account these paradoxes, as well as the biological, intrapsychic and social prerequisites for the development of types of lies.</p><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Biblical qualities of a good man</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2BlG9ncGWUnrOnsdGepa1lpK69pr%2BMpaCeq12axaK5z6WcrGaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-scoring-works-dancing-with-the-stars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Does the Scoring Really Work on 'Dancing With the Stars'?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./402478-working-home-reduced-office-occupancy-nairobi-by-47-2020-report-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Working from home reduced office occupancy in Nairobi by 47% in 2020, report</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
