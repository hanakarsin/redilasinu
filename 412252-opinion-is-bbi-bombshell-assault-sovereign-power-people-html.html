One celebrating the ruling by the high court and the other either castigating the five judges or calling for a way out of what they call activists dispensation of justice.</p><p class=align-left>In fact, these judges can be said to have taken Plato’s idea of a few wise men to the hilt. They actually made a ruling that they think is good for the country and what we need to interrogate is whether they qualify to be the few wise men on whose hands we are safe!</p><p class=align-left>One peculiar thing is that majority of those happy with the ruling are essentially the very people who have been opposed to BBI and the BBI amendment bill for close to the last three years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Famous South African proverbs and sayings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>And it is becoming clear they are in the minority as many Kenyans are coming out to call for an appeal and an immediate stay order.</p><p class=align-left>Let us assume that the ruling is by wise men in whose hands we are safe like Plato says. In doing so we may also want to ask why there a common thread in their pronouncement that seems to perfectly fit within the Tanga Tanga motif.</p><p class=align-left>Are we at this point talking of judicial activism that has taken positions on political issues and could it be that the manifestation of this activism is not wise in as far as public interest is concerned but an opportunity to use the legal space to hit on the president?</p><p class=align-left>It is in black and white that even though the petition was about the BBI amendment bill, the bench outdid itself in roping in the president.</p><p class=align-left>It is instructive to note that the popular initiative is a route and will always take a political angle. Globally, constitutional changes and processes are political and there is no day you will have it any other way.</p><p class=align-left>It is politicians who allocate and distribute resources and to this end, they amend the constitution or enact laws that make it possible for the allocation and distribution of resources in a manner that benefits the people they represent.</p><p class=align-left>Our good constitution has all these provisions that protect it from errant politicians who may want to mutilate the constitution for their own political expediency.</p><p class=align-left>That is why there is a parliamentary route and a popular initiative route. These routes have safety valves.</p><p class=align-left>Take the popular initiative rule for instance. Irrespective of the initiators or promoters, and the constitution does not spell who should be a promoter, the process has the people at its core.</p><p class=align-left>First, the people have to support the idea by appending at least one million signatures.</p><p class=align-left>This in itself means no busy body can wake up and get their way with ludicrous changes in the constitution and these one million Kenyans must be from all over the country.</p><p class=align-left>The fundamental question we need to ask is whether a court has the powers to wish away the endorsement of a popular initiative even when more than four million Kenyans from diverse backgrounds supported the initiative.</p><p class=align-left>The issue of the promoters notwithstanding, aren't we supposed to have fidelity to the sovereign power of the people as enshrined in article one of the constitution.</p><p class=align-left>You see, there is a sense in which the ruling is usurping this sovereign power of the people and this sets a dangerous precedent.</p><p class=align-left>It is like Kenyans will need to be signing informed consent forms to corroborate their signatures and attendant support for a popular initiative.</p><p class=align-left>We need not sit pretty and not question the ruling, especially on the question of public participation as there is that insinuation that those who signed the document had not read and engaged with it.</p><p class=align-left>Then why are we in this space where 85% of Kenyans are literally in mourning because their dreams of a prosperous Kenya with more devolved funds have been shattered? And those celebrating?</p><p class=align-left>Aren't they celebrating because they read the document and have some fundamental issues with it!</p><p class=align-left>So why is the ruling stopping us from moving to a popular referendum yet we live in a democracy where the majority have their way and the minority their say.</p><p class=align-left>Lawyers will come in with interpretations and even disparage different people who hold different opinions but the truth of the matter is that fundamentally the ruling touches on the sovereign power of the people.</p><p class=align-left>The sovereign power of the people is the only safety valve that protects the people from the wisdom of a few ‘wise rulers’ and not even court rulings should usurp that power.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>The writer is H.H.O.O, a scholar, media researcher, and regular commentator on political issues.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>The views expressed here are his and do not represent the position of TUKO.co.ke.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
