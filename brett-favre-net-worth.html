Over the course of 15 years spanning from 1992-2007, Favre was synonymous with the Packers and served as their most legendary quarterback. During that time, he lead the team to two Super Bowls and became the first and only NFL player to win three consecutive AP MVP awards.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With all of that being said, Favre's influence on professional football as a whole cannot be understated by any means.

In Favre's case, that's entirely true — to the tune of millions.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Brett Favre</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Former professional football player</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $100 million</p><p>Brett Favre is a former American professional football player who was the quarterback of of the Atlanta Falcons and the Green Bay Packers. He has an estimated net worth of $100 million as of the time of writing, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Oct. 10, 1969</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Gulfport, Miss.</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Brett Lorenzo Favre</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Irvin Ernest Favre</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Bonita Ann (née French)</p><p><strong>Marriages:</strong> Deanna Tynes (1996-present)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Daughters Brittany Favre and Breleigh Favre</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Southern Mississippi University</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Texts from the former governor of Mississippi governor about Brett Favre have sparked controversy.</h2><p>It appears as though Brett's name is caught up in a pretty serious legal situation that also involves former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant. Indeed, some recently revealed texts, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mississippi Today</a>, show that the quarterback received guidance from the former statesman on how to reallocate funds set aside for welfare communities to a new volleyball stadium so that it would be accepted by the Mississippi Department of Human Services.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The texts in question are quite damning. "Can we help [Favre] with his project. We should meet soon to see how I can make sure we keep your projects on course," wrote the former governor in one message to nonprofit founder Nancy New in July of 2019, just weeks after Bryant ousted the former welfare agency director John Davis for suspected fraud.</p><p>In a conversation between Favre and Bryant where the athlete questioned the governor's shuffling around of department heads, he responded with "I will handle that… long story but had to make a change. But I will call Nancy and see what it will take."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In another text exchange, Favre asks Nancy New, "If you were to pay me, is there any way the media can find out where it came from and how much?"</p><p>"No, we never have had that information publicized," Nancy assures him in a reply. "I understand you being uneasy about that though."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brett Favre's involvement seems to have been to help his daughter's volleyball career.</h2><p>The filing claims that Bryant, Favre, New, and Davis all co-conspired to redirect roughly $5 million that was allocated to Mississippi's welfare funds to instead build a brand new volleyball stadium at the University of Southern Mississippi, where Favre's daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breleigh Favre</a>, goes to school.</p><p>Favre publicly received the lion's share of credit for developing and undertaking the project, but these new details certainly cast a new light on the controversial behind-the-scenes machinations of the project.</p><p>Bryant has denied involvement in the project for years, but one of the recently released texts reportedly even shows that the stadium was set to be named after him at a point.</p><p>According to Mississippi Today, New has already plead guilty to 13 felony charges related to the situation and Davis is currently awaiting trial. As for Favre and Davis, neither have been officially charged with any crimes as of the time of writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BmwNNmnZquopp6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./62-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>62 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-riihimaki-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LaurDIY - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
