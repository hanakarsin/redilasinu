While contestants are trapped for hours drinking and mingling, fans get to see the good, the bad, and the ugly come out. Women have cried, screamed, and interrupted their way into and out of the hearts of Bachelor Nation. While it's easy to zero in on the most dramatic of the bunch, sometimes the quiet ones are the loudest. That's why we love Daisy Kent.</p><p>Philadelphia native and former Charity Lawson lover <a href=#>Joey Graziadei</a> has his hands full in Season 28. From a pair of sisters to a secret envelope that gives a contestant the ability to steal a one-on-one date, this season is different. Despite the madness, one gal has already earned a place in the hearts of Bachelor Nation. Daisy is sweet, funny, and seemingly far more grounded than her fellow contestants. Folks already think she and Joey are endgame. Are <a href=#>Daisy and Joey still together after The Bachelor</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Joe and Daisy on 'The Bachelor'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Are Daisy and Joey still loving it up after 'The Bachelor?' We hope so!</h2><p>"I'm having a really good time. All the girls are super nice," Daisy said on night one. She also admitted to feeling overwhelmed but thought it might be because she has hearing loss due to Ménière’s disease. Daisy has a cochlear implant but as she explained in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, the sounds and voices bouncing off the walls can be overwhelming. Daisy is incredibly likable. It's easy to see why Joey was "captivated" by her after a single conversation.</p><p>She sets herself apart from other contestants by genuinely wanting Joey to have the best experience on the show.</p><p>"I'm so excited for you," said Daisy. "Whatever happens, I'll be cheering you on."</p><p>That sentiment is in stark contrast with other contestants who very much have an "every person for themselves" attitude. It's very endearing and refreshing. You can literally see Joey's entire demeanor change as he takes in what Daisy is saying. Also not for nothing, their kiss looked very natural.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(SPOILER): Photo & video of Joey and Daisy arriving at Daisy’s house today in MN for her hometown date. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P3FpYf8g29</a></p>— RealitySteve (@RealitySteve) <a href=#>October 24, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@RealitySteve</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">If the rumors are true, Daisy and Joey are definitely getting engaged!</h2><p>At the risk of reading too much into things, it certainly says something that Joey chose Daisy for his first one-on-one date.</p><p>"Daisy had something about her on night one that I can't get out of my head," explained Joey. To do that, he whisked her away on a helicopter to the BeachLife Festival at Redondo Beach. The Bachelor is so good at creating fairytale moments, but having Joey and Daisy dance on stage in front of thousands, which of course ended in a kiss, was a highlight.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a>, Daisy and Joey will be heading down the aisle soon. They were allegedly engaged during Episode 11 in Tulum, Mexico. While Reality Steve was unwilling to share proof, he did locate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pictures of the two of them during the hometown dates</a>. They definitely look like a comfortable couple who have to share a kiss in front of a camera crew, for now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecOaoKyxXZa7pXnJqJyyZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzecGamqGdnKS%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dominique-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Dominiques | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-cook-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Cook - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
