The Discovery Channel captured when Billy Brown took his kids to inspect the ship and informed them that he wanted to buy it. After buying it, the family didn't hesitate to make memories on the boat. In one episode, Ami Brown cooked breakfast on the ship for the entire family during their fishing trip.</p><p>The Brown family ended up giving the "Integrity" to another family. Years later, they discovered it was available for them to own again and they immediately jumped at the opportunity. With the ship in their possession after the death of their father, Billy's children embark on the newest chapter of their lives.

Technology allows people to buy houses online without physically seeing the property. Still, Noah wanted to see the property before jumping the gun and buying a place he may not like — hence, the voyage with Rain at the ship's helm. <a href=#>Before Gabe joined</a>, the group traveled from Juneau to Petersburg.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alaskan Bush People (@alaskanbushppl)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@alaskanbushppl</a></figure><p>Gabe left the ranch and met up with the group in Petersburg to help them during the trip.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alaskan Bush People (@alaskanbushppl)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@alaskanbushppl</a></figure><p>Another Instagram clip revealed that the group decided to head to Mosman Island because it's where <a href=#>Billy and Ami began</a> their Alaskan bush life. However, the journey to Mosman became dangerous as dark clouds loomed over the "Integrity." The captain, Rain, had to overcome the storm, which caused heavy rain and crashing waves. In addition to the storm, Rain had to navigate through the Wrangell Narrows, a shallow and winding channel.</p><p>"The Wrangell Narrows is a notoriously dangerous passage filled with changing depths, underwater rock formations, and sunken boats," the narrator said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alaskan Bush People (@alaskanbushppl)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@alaskanbushppl</a></figure><p>While the voyage was difficult due to the weather conditions, some of the Brown family members on the ship also found it difficult because the boat brought fond members of their deceased father, Billy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@alaskanbushppl</a><p>Noah and Eli</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bird joined the trip on the "Integrity" to find herself.</h2><p><a href=#>Bird</a> was one of the Brown family members who took Billy's death the hardest.

Under the assumption that they would buy the boat, Bear Brown surprised them with news that they would give the family the ship for free because that's how Billy got the boat, through a handshake tradition.</p><p>"The first boast we ever brought, I was a little baby.
