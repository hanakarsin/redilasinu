Jason has been with the Mavericks since 2021, and following his first chance to coach the team in the <a href=#>NBA</a> finals, many want to learn more about the head coach and former player's personal life.</p><p>Among the details that many are curious about, some are wondering whether Jason has ever been married. He's been married twice over the course of his life, and those relationships have not always been smooth sailing. Here's what we know about each marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jason Kidd and wife Porschla Kidd in 2023</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Jason Kidd married?</h2><p>Jason has been married to Porschla Coleman, a former model, since 2011. The two dated for about three years before they were married following Jason's divorce from his previous marriage in 2007. (More on his previous marriage later.) Jason and Porschla have three children together: Chance was born in 2010, Noah was born in 2012, and Cooper was born in 2017. She is also stepmother to Jason's three children from his previous marriage: Trey Jason and twins Miah and Jezelle.</p><p>Porschla, who is originally from Mississippi, always looked at her modeling career primarily as a business.</p><p>“It seems like a glamorous life, but the industry has to be looked at as a business. Always be professional even when others are not, be on time and show that you are serious," she told Seventeen in 2012. “Coming from Gulfport, Mississippi, where fashion and modeling are planets away, I fell victim to trying to break into the modeling world through scouting events at pricey hotels.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chance Kidd (@thechancekidd)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Jason Kidd's ex-wife?</h2><p>Although public reports suggest that his current marriage has not had major issues, Jason's previous marriage to Joumana Kidd was far less sanguine. The two were married in 1997, and in 2001, Jason was arrested and pled guilty to a domestic abuse charge for assaulting her. As part of his sentence, Jason was ordered to attend anger management classes for six months. He continued to attend the classes even after that period ended.</p><p>Jason filed for divorce in January of 2007 and contended that their marriage was characterized by intense jealousy, paranoia, and the threat of "false domestic abuse claims." He cited "extreme cruelty" as the reason that the divorce was necessary. A month later, Joumana filed a counterclaim, saying that Jason abused her and citing a specific incident where he "broke her rib and damaged her hearing by smashing her head into the console of a car."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jason Kidd and first wife Joumana Kidd in 2006</p></figure><p>These allegations understandably still color the way that Jason is viewed by the public. He was arrested again in 2012 for driving while intoxicated, but has not faced any allegations of domestic abuse in more than a decade.</p><p>All this took place while Jason continued to play in the NBA, and after his playing career was over, he was hired as a coach almost immediately, even as some still remember exactly what he was accused of.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81moqKclGK6or7Ropyd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./more-woes-for-hushpuppi-as-court-uncovers-fresh-400000-fraud-committed-behind-bars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Hushpuppi On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./henry-insatiable-season-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can Henry, 'Insatiable' Season 2's Newest Character, Save the Show?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
