Though there has been no official announcement from the network on if there is going to be a Season 4 of Stranger Things, producer and director Shawn Levy confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> in 2018 that it is happening.</p><p>“I mean I will say we have a good sense of stuff that happens in Season 4. Season 4 is definitely happening," he told Collider. "There's very much the possibility of a season beyond that one, that’s currently undecided."&nbsp;</p><p>During the season finale of Stranger Things, we saw our group divided, beloved Hawkins Police Chief <a href=#>Jim Hopper (possibly?) deceased</a>, Eleven left powerless, and a Demogorgon still alive.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what does this mean for our favorite group of kids who like to play videos and save the day when their small Indiana town is in trouble? Basically, their world is still upside down...</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There will most likely be a Season 4 of Stranger Things &nbsp;— here’s what we know.</h2><p>It was a sad moment for fans in Episode 8 of Season 3 of Stranger Things. Above ground in the Starcourt mall, the kids are left to battle the Mind Flayer while Hopper and Joyce Byers head below to an underground lab being run by Russians. To close the gate to the other world, Hopper seemingly sacrifices himself and the lab explodes, leaving Joyce and his adoptive daughter Eleven assuming he perished.</p><p>In a post-credit clip, the scene cuts to a military base in Kamchatka, Russia, where the Soviets reveal they are holding an American captive. Though the face of the American is not revealed, fans (including us) hope that means Hopper is still alive. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Speaking about his character’s fate, David Harbour has been tight-lipped about giving any potential spoilers away. “I wish the best for the show no matter what. And in terms of my involvement, I love the show, but we’ll have to see what happens moving forward. I don’t really know,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. “The Duffers (creators of the show), I do believe, have a plan, but we’ll have to see what they have in mind.”</p><p>Killing off secondary characters in the series has become a theme in the Stranger Things saga. Fans have watched Barb (Season 1), Bob (Season 2), and Billy (Season 3) all die at the hands (or tentacles) of the creatures released from the Upside Down. Has Hopper met the same fate? We sure hope not!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Similar to actor David’s stance on not giving away any possible spoilers into the next installment of the series, the Duffer Brothers (Matt and Ross) teased the future of the franchise. “Assuming there’s a Season 4, obviously the question of who that American is in that cell and then also what they’re doing with the Demogorgon, that is a tease,” Ross told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “We try to tee up some Season 4.”&nbsp;</p><p>The co-creator also explained the decision behind writing in that Eleven loses her telekinetic powers after being bitten by the Mind Flayer. “We didn’t want an ending again this year where Eleven comes in [at] the last second and holds out her hand and saves the day,” Ross explained. &nbsp;</p><p>He added: “Moving into Season 4, how much more vulnerable does that make our characters in a group?” The writer concluded, “Inevitably, evil resurfaces that they can’t just lean on Eleven to come in and save the day. We think it ups the scare factor in a big way.” Yes, it does.</p><p>You can stream Season 3 of Stranger Things on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeqZ5ll6S2r7OMraZmmpVirm6%2F06uYp5%2BVp3q1tMinnqxlo5qutLvNZms%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tandis-esfandiari-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tandis Esfandiari - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./february20-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>February 20 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
