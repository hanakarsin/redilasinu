We don’t know what is responsible for that but we felt that with his closeness to Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu), he was supposed to be given a prominent role in the campaign.</p><p>“As a true party man, he will definitely contribute towards the success of Asiwaju during the next election. But we felt that he deserved to be there. He knows Asiwaju very well; he knows him in and out. Asiwaju also knows his capabilities. At a certain point in time, he was the DG of Asiwaju when he was campaigning for the governorship in Lagos State.</p><p>“We felt he deserves more, but if the party hierarchy says that he has to come in as a member of the Executive Committee, there must be a reason behind that which is not known to us. He is a party man who is loyal to the party. Ogbeni Aregbesola will definitely play his role during the next election.”</p><h2>They Have Other Roles</h2><p>Meanwhile, it would be recalled that the Director General of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Governor Simon Lalong</strong></a> had previously disclosed that some prominent party leaders who were not included in the Presidential Campaign Council have other roles to play at other levels.</p><p>He made the submission following the reactions that greeted the absence of some names on the list.</p><p>Lalong emphasized that such persons have different critical roles to play at regional, zonal, state local government, ward, and unit levels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49qZpqqlZyvpr%2FOpZisZZOWurF50Z6tnpmcqHqxvsSsoJ2dnqm2oriMnJinnJmZrrWxjK2fnmWdnruqv9OeqWavmaG5bsPOq6Jmnp%2BneqKy056pZqCVYsSiv4ylnJ%2BsXaTCtXnOn2StoZ6qr7a%2FjJyYpqiRnrSvecKorKebmaF8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-combs-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Country Music Star Luke Combs and His Wife Nicole Will Soon Be a Family of Four!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
