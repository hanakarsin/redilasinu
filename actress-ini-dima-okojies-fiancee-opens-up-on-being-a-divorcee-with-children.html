Today is the last day of the last month of me being single as I marry my baby next month. I was married before and have 2 girls (I used to post about my girls but as more eyes came to my page I stopped because as a father, protecting is my job). After 8 years of marriage (I got married at 26) we filed for a divorce in 2018.</p><p>“We were young and made mistakes and I had struggled with bouts of depression. 2018 was my toughest year ever! Requesting a divorce was one of the toughest things I ever did but it was about survival. I am not accusing anyone… just speaking about my own struggles as a human being. Suffice it to say that my life has been the stuff you read about in books and I kept it all inside. Only those in my inner circle know my story and perhaps one day I might write about it”.</p><p>Speaking on his relationship with Ini Dima-Okojie, Abasi Eneobong said he had never thought of remarrying because he was wounded and hurt.</p><p>However, he reached out to Ini Dima-Okojie <a href=#>after he commenced his divorce</a> but never met her in person until 2019.</p><p>Abasi Eneobong also revealed how he struggled to keep up with Ini Dima-Okojie to avoid making the same mistake in his first marriage.</p><p>He said: “Now back to 2nd chances. Coming out of my earlier situation I never believed that I would remarry. I was wounded and hurt. I first reached out to Ini after we had commenced our divorce process via DM (we all know that story) but never met her in person till sometime in 2019. We started talking as friends and eventually started dating in the second half of 2019. (I remember when I told her about the circumstances of my divorce, her response was “that’s your version but I’m sure there’s another version that’s equally true”). But wounded people wound people. And every time I saw we would get close I would end the relationship because I was afraid of committing.</p><p>“Yet when I was away from her I couldn’t function. This happened a few times and ultimately I had to seek professional help with a clinical psychologist to deal with my past trauma. What became clear to me was that she was my 2nd chance that I never thought I deserved. And I always functioned better whenever she was in my life.</p><p>“Well maybe I’m sharing too much, but I have now received a lot of healing and continue to be healed. And as the good book says, “love covers a multitude of sins”, and her love for sure is healing me daily. Ini I am looking forward to saying “I do” in a few weeks time. Thanks for the second chance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FyZpqbpKeytL%2BMoqWiZZSeuqJ5zqSmo6GVqHqntcCnmp6dXaS9prrSZqypZZ%2BjeqOxyKeeZpldmba3u9GcnJ5lp57BqXnCoaClnKKau3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./canada-imposes-travel-ban-on-nigeria-over-omicron.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Canada Imposes Travel Ban On Nigeria Over Omicron</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dababy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Dababy On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
