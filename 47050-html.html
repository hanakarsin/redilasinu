So you can see why we are very grateful to UBA for this wonderful gesture” said Obinna Onodugo, the acting Medical Director of UNTH, Enugu, while receiving the Incubators.</p><p>He commended UBA for the kind gesture, noting that this would go a long way in increasing the survival chances of babies born with health challenges requiring the use of Incubators.</p><p>His counterpart at AKTH, Professor Aminu Zakari Mohammed, described the donation as timely and would go a long way in reducing infant mortality in the country. “We assure UBA that this gesture will be well utilized as we have a culture of maintaining our equipment” he said. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>l-r: Directorate Head, Far North Bank UBA Plc, Abubakar Bello; Chief Medical Director, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) Professor Aminu Zakari Mohammed; MD/CEO, UBA Foundation, Ijeoma Aso; and Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee AKTH, Dr. Mohammed Sani Mijinyawa, during the presentation of Incubators to the Hospital by UBA Foundation, in Kano on Tuesday.</strong></p><p>The Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee AKTH, Dr. Mohammed Sani Mijinyawa in his brief remarks said that the donation of incubators to the teaching hospital is the first of its kind by any corporate body or financial institution while the Director Administration, Alhaji Mohammed Suleiman said that this gesture will outlive the bank as whoever helps save a life, has helped save humanity.</p><p>The head of department of Pediatrics, UNTH, Ifeoma Emodi, a Professor, expressed appreciation to the bank emphasizing that the donation would help in fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between the hospital and the bank.</p><p>Casmir Molokwu, Regional Bank Head, Enugu, UBA Plc, who led the delegation to the UNTH Enugu, emphasized UBA’s commitment to doing business in a sustainable way by supporting the communities where it operates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>L-r:&nbsp;Directorate Head, Far North Bank, UBA Plc, Abubakar Bello; Chief Medical Director, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) Professor Aminu Zakari Mohammed;&nbsp;Consultant Paediatrician in Charge of Special Care Baby Unit AKTH, Dr. Zubaide Farouk;&nbsp;and MD/CEO, UBA Foundation, Ijeoma Aso, during the presentation of Incubators to the Hospital by UBA Foundation, in Kano on Tuesday.</strong></p><p>Similarly, Directorate Head, Far North Bank, Abubakar Bello, who said that he has been a beneficiary of the AKTH’s expertise in managing the health of his twin babies at infancy through the Special Care Baby Unit of the hospital, noted that UBA understands clearly what it means to partner and support health institutions across the country including AKTH.
