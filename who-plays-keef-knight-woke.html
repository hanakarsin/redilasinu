The encounter leaves Keef traumatized, and he begins to see the world in an entirely different way than he previously did.</p><p>If you're a fan of New Girl, then you'll definitely recognize the actor who brings this character to life in <a href=#>Hulu's Woke</a>. Let's get to know more about Lamorne Morris.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Lamorne Morris played one of Zooey Deschanel's roommates on 'New Girl.'</h2><p>Before <a href=#>Lamorne Morris</a> played Keef Knight in Woke, he was best known playing Winston, one of Jess's roommates on the hit sitcom <a href=#>New Girl</a>. Winston was a former professional basketball player — though as the ninth guy on the bench for the eighth best team in Latvia, he clearly wasn't a very good one.</p><p>Given the countless number of YouTube fan videos dedicated the iconic Winston moments, the hilarious character was certainly a New Girl fan-favorite throughout the entire series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Nasim Pedrad as Aly and Lamorne Morris as Winston in 'New Girl'</p></figure><p>Some of Lamorne's other notable roles include the character of Kevin in the 2018 comedy flick Game Night, the main character of Darrin in the National Geographic docudrama series Valley of the Boom, and Jerrod in Barbershop: The Next Cut. According to Lamorne's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, he has an impressive 68 acting credits to his name.</p><p>Per Lamorne's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb biography</a>, the actor had something slightly in common with his New Girl character. Lamorne wanted to be a professional basketball player, but he eventually settled on an acting career. He's also a comedian, writer, director, and producer.</p><p>He wrote one episode of New Girl in which Winston, working as a police officer, dates a Black woman who's an activist against police brutality. He's also served as a producer on several projects. He's listed as an executive producer on the 2020 film Death of a Telemarketer, which Lamorne also starred in. He also wrote and produced the 2021 fictional podcast series Unwanted, about two slackers who attempt to catch an escaped murderer in order to cash in on the $1 million reward the police are offering.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Does Lamorne Morris have a wife or kids?</h2><p>Lamorne Morris isn't currently married. He previously dated E! host Erin Lim, who posted a few photos of herself and Lamorne on social media beginning in 2016. The couple also appeared together on the red carpet at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 Emmy Awards</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lamorne Morris (@lamorne)</a></p></figure><p>However, since the pair broke up in 2018, Lamorne has kept his romantic life incredibly on the downlow. (There's been no hint of a possible girlfriend on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> page.) That said, the 38-year-old actor has posted adorable pictures with a cute baby girl who he obviously adores. Many fans assume the girl is his daughter, though Lamorne has not officially confirmed that.</p><p>You can catch Lamorne as cartoonist Keef Knight in Seasons 1 and 2 of Woke, currently streaming on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaCyprKMpKWin5iperi7yp4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kabs-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Kabs Family - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
