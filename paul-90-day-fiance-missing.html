Paul said he was "on a long work trip" and had taken Pierre along with him because the child has "extreme separation anxiety."</p><p>Paul said his 16-month-old was staying with Paul's mother while he and Pierre were traveling. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Child Protective Services took custody of Ethan while he was his in grandmother's care.
