We do, immensely, value those words as they, indeed, helped us appreciate the depth of the love you have for us," wrote Bushiri.<p class=align-left>The couple's followers, who are always near, quickly headed to the comment section to praise the couple and once again shower them with thoughtful words of kindness.</p><p class=align-left>Read a few of their comments below:</p><p class=align-left>Nalukui Muyumbana said:</p>"The fearless general, my father you are such an example to all of us we love you so much dad and mom.
