Perhaps, it will be a battle between the old and the new order with Nigerians proving that they have attained political maturity. Indeed, the activities of political actors offer enough basis for tea leaf reading as far as the 2023 season goes. The earliest of these indicators emerged when an otherwise taciturn President Muhammadu Buhari refused to name his likely successor on the basis that “he may be eliminated if I mention his name”.</p><p>This disclosure in an interview with Channels Television indicates that the President already has a horse in the race slated for February next year. While there may be other intelligent reasons why the identity of this person must be a secret, for now, how the President couched his response smacks of fait accompli. When deconstructed, it suggests that this preferred candidate is bound to become the next President hence it is best to protect the favoured from ambitious politicians who brook no obstacle. The fear of elimination suggests that whoever enjoys the backing of Buhari stands a better chance of becoming President than the person most Nigerians want to occupy Aso Villa in 2023.</p><p>The Police Service Commission (PSC) has is pushing for the immediate dismissal and prosecution of disgraced Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari.</p><p>Recall that the former commander of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) was suspended from office on August 1, 2021, following his indictment by the FBI for allegedly conniving with internet fraudster Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, to defraud a Qatari businessman.</p><p>The supercop was accused of collecting $1 million to arrest and detain another member of the criminal syndicate for several weeks who was at loggerheads with Hushpuppi.</p><p>Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari cannot be friends with politicians who steal from the coffers of the nation.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Adesina made this known in an article titled: “PMB and NDDC,” released via his Facebook page on Thursday night.</p><p>He disclosed that the President hates corruption with passion and would continue to fight the war against the menace until his tenure expires in 2023.</p><p>The&nbsp;Academic Staff Union of Universities&nbsp;(ASUU) on Friday threatened to embark on strike following the delay in the decision of the Federal Government to resolve the lingering crisis in universities.</p><p>ASUU described the defence of IPPIS as shameful, claiming that there had been fraud in its implementation as indicated in the 2021 report submitted to the National Assembly by the Auditor General of the Federation.</p><p>The union lamented over the meetings with the federal government which has failed to yield any result.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Dr Vincent Olatunji as the National Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB).</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the appointment was approved following a request&nbsp;by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy,&nbsp;Prof. Isa Pantami.</p><p>In a statement on Friday issued by the Spokesperson of the minister, Uwa Suleiman the appointment is with immediate effect.</p><p>Several&nbsp;Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP)&nbsp;leaders and fighters were killed on Thursday night by the Nigerian military in Marte District, Borno State.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the ISWAP terrorists were neutralised by soldiers of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) during massive airstrikes on their camps in Gamboru, Abbaganaram, Bukar Mairam and Jubularam villages.</p><p>It was learned that ISWAP leadership is currently evacuating the dead bodies of the terrorists killed by the Nigerian military.</p><p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) has countered the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over its offer to make Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu its candidate in the 2023 governorship election in Lagos.</p><p>The APC which described the PDP offer as a worthless Greek gift said it is rather unfortunate that the opposition party can’t find any qualified person within its fold to present as its gubernatorial candidate and now has to try poaching Sanwo-Olu.</p><p>Naija News reports the Lagos APC’s reaction comes after a chieftain of the opposition party in Lagos, Ganiu Taofik, said the incumbent Governor could have done better if he was in PDP.</p><p>Former Governor of Enugu State, Okwesilieze Nwodo has said the likes of Senators Anyim Pius Anyim, Orji Uzor Kalu, and Rochas Okorocha are eminently qualified to rule the country in 2023.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday during an interview on Arise News, Nwodo said it is the time for an Igbo presidency, asking the parties to zone their presidential tickets to the South East.</p><p>He condemned the claims in some quarters that the Igbos are not competent enough to provide credible leadership to the country, saying that such claims are meant to deny Igbo presidency.</p><p>The Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has inaugurated state chairmen of the party in Abuja.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Buni, who was represented by the Secretary of the committee,&nbsp;John Akpanudoedehe, swore in the chairmen for 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p><p>Akpanudoedehe, however, failed to inaugurate state chairmen for Kano and Sokoto due to the internal crisis in the two states which had resulted in parallel congresses.</p><p>Students of Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, have protested against the incessant killing of their colleagues by trailers and trucks in the town.</p><p>Naija News reports that some students of the institution have been killed in accidents involving trailers, but the latest tragic incident that occurred on Wednesday led to the protest.</p><p>It was gathered that a 400 level student who was simply identified as Michael was killed on Thursday evening by a trailer coming from Ikare-Akoko.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
