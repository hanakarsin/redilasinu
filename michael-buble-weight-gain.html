The 44-year-old is the first to admit that he’s struggled with the occasional <a href=#>weight gain</a> throughout his 25-year career, but he’s always been able to bounce back from his self-described "fat Bublé" phases.</p><p>At least three times over the last decade, the Canadian has made headlines for losing a significant amount of weight — so what’s the secret behind these periodic transformations?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael Bublé combats weight gain with the help of his wife.</h2><p>Eighteen months into their marriage, the Grammy winner revealed that wife Luisana Lopilato is his fitness guide. "It's much easier when you're with somebody who's that disciplined," he said of the model’s dedicated workout routine in a 2012 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I've gone on diets, and I've gone up and down with my weight. But keeping healthy is certainly simpler when you're with your wife and you say, 'What do you want to do today?' and she says, 'Let's go to the gym...'" he explained.</p><p>Michael added that his eating habits had also improved. "In some of those [old] pictures of me I looked pregnant!" he confessed, noting that he "cut out bread, rice, and pasta" to achieve his slimmer look.</p><p>A few months after welcoming his and Luisana’s second child in 2016, Michael again showed off a smaller figure as he left the hospital following vocal surgery. But in November of that year, the "Haven’t Met You Yet" songwriter retreated from the public eye after announcing that his then 3-year-old son, Noah, had been diagnosed with liver cancer.</p><p>In a "Carpool Karaoke" segment with James Corden two years later, Michael discussed his fluctuating weight in an effort to lighten the mood following questions about his son’s health battle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"There’s a fat Bublé, a chinny Bublé, and then there’s a 'Hey, I’ve got a record coming out maybe I should stop eating those Slurpees,'" he teased, adding that the appearance of a certain body part motivates him to keep the pounds off.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel like when you’re smaller your penis looks bigger," he shared. "Because when you’re bigger like that it looks like a buoy sitting in the middle of an ocean."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael was reminded of what truly matters in life amid his son’s cancer treatment.</h2><p>The record producer recognized that he’d been consumed by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music industry rat race</a> before Noah’s illness brought his world to a screeching halt. "The diagnosis made me realize how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things," he told the Daily Mail. "I was embarrassed by my ego."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The epiphany inspired Michael to make some permanent changes. "I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have," he said in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Luisana also acted as a pillar for Michael during their son’s recovery. "When they got [the cancer] out and chemo was done, I fell," he admitted. "My wife picks me up now."</p><p>Thankfully, Noah has been cancer-free for the past three years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2aapZe5pnnWnqCgoKRitKK1zQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-stanley-nwabali-receives-heros-welcome-at-chippa-united-days-after-afcon-final.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stanley Nwabali Receives Heros Welcome At Chippa United Days After AFCON Final</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marla-thomas-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marla Thomas - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
