(EXCLUSIVE)</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-dSnYFs eqMhYP">Jamie Lerner</a><p class="sc-hYRTcE cWmyoM">Jan. 25 2023, Published 1:12 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=#

series <a href=#>The Vow</a> cited that Raniere had several relationships with multiple women during his time as the leader of NXIVM.</p><p>While some women claim they were coerced into having a sexual relationship with Raniere through blackmail, some former members state that their relationships were consensual.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Clyne opened up about her decade-long romance with Raniere and said that the women who were involved with the NXIVM leader "knew the deal up front."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener

upfront."</h2><p style=text-align:start>In a court document unsealed in 2020, Clyne said she was Raniere’s partner for “over a decade” as she came to the NXIVM leader’s defense.</p><p style=text-align:start>Writing a letter of support for Raniere to a Brooklyn federal judge, Clyne said it was “absurd” to say NXIVM “was created for Keith to have sex partners,” as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported at the time.</p><p>In an interview with Distractify, she stated that the idea of Raniere having all those relationships wasn't plausible.</p><p>"Being able to have all of these sexual relationships is crazy to me. It's not even physically possible. If you look at all of the allegations and then you count in that he was building 30 to 40 active companies and projects, he was constantly going on walks with people and [playing] volleyball, and then you have to factor in eating and sleeping. It just doesn't add up," she said. "But I understand that it's very entertaining."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Dossier Project (@thedossierproject)</a></p></figure><p>"He had partners for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years," she continued. "And everyone who was involved with him knew the deal upfront and could change their mind at any time if they wanted to have a different type of relationship. I can't obviously speak for anyone else and why they stayed. And I know there are people who've publicly said that they felt they couldn't leave and I sympathize with that. But at the end of the day, we're the only ones who can be responsible for our own decisions."</p><p>Today, Clyne still stands behind Raniere and hopes that he'll be able to successfully fight back against the justice system.</p><p>"I was in the meetings where we were talking about the craziness of the charges and how easy it was going to be to prove that these were all consenting adults," she revealed. "And you don't have to agree but regretting a decision that, at the end of the day, isn't all that alternative compared to what a lot of people do, that's not a crime."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Barbara Bouchey, an ex of Raniere’s, said she found out he was involved with 12 other women.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>Aside from Clyne, some of Raniere’s partners — including Barbara Bouchey and Toni Natalie — have gone on the record about having had relationships with the man who’s now serving 120 years in prison.</p><p style=text-align:start>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popsugar</a>, Bouchey met Raniere in 2000 after being introduced to him by <a href=#>Nancy Salzman</a>, and they dated until 2009.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Keith was a very dynamic person,” Bouchey said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2018 interview with Megyn Kelly</a>. “He was very soft-spoken, very engaging in dialogues. He was funny, he was witty, he could play the piano.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Bouchey later found out that there were 12 women he was seeing during that timeframe. “I didn’t know for a year that there was anybody else he was involved with,” she said. “I and other people got to see the glimmers of this dark side of Keith and the abuse within his inner circle that started to trickle down.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Toni Natalie</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Toni Natalie, another ex-girlfriend, said Raniere “finds your vulnerabilities and then he preys on them.”</h2><p style=text-align:start>Natalie discussed her relationship with Raniere in The Program: Inside the Mind of Keith Raniere and the Rise and Fall of NXIVM, a book she wrote with journalist Chet Hardin.</p><p style=text-align:start>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat & Chronicle</a>, Natalie met Raniere in 1991, when he was operating a multilevel marketing company called Consumer’s Byline. She became a top seller for that company, left her husband, moved to Albany, N.Y., and started a relationship with Raniere that lasted until 1999.</p><p style=text-align:start>After their breakup, Natalie’s house was broken into and her family was threatened, according to court documents cited by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>. And when Natalie filed for bankruptcy — after her and Raniere’s health-food business failed — Raniere and his supporters waged a legal battle with her that one judge said “smacks of a jilted fellow’s attempt at revenge,” according to the magazine.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Keith finds your vulnerabilities, and then he preys on them,” Natalie told Vanity Fair.</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=#><strong>RAINN.org</strong></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKqwMdmqZqmmZq%2FpnnPmqmtppWnwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./papa-johns-shaq-a-roni.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Papa John's Is Releasing a Shaq-Sized Pie Called the Shaq-a-Roni</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maureen-esisi-exposes-things-nigerians-did-to-her-after-blossom-chukwujekwus-wedding-photos-hit-the-internet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maureen Esisi Exposes Things Nigerians Did To Her After Blossom Chukwujekwu's Wedding Photos Hit The</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
