He was in a coma for six days following the trauma to his brain.&nbsp;Less than a week after announcing Landon's death, Camryn returned to her YouTube channel to discuss what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"My Husband Passed Away | Telling His Story,"</a> Camryn confirmed that Landon died by suicide after struggling with depression and anxiety for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>"Landon has always had his issues mentally. He is someone who is not as open about it. I share everything with you guys and I've always been very open with my struggles about depression and anxiety. That's just me. I get a lot of comfort in talking to you guys about these things," Camryn said.&nbsp;</p><p>She described her husband as "quiet and secretive," and that he had struggled to open up about what he was going through.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Camryn said that Landon got more depressed around the time she got pregnant with their second child, Delilah (she was born in May of 2020).&nbsp;</p><p>Landon saw a psychiatrist at this point, and he was prescribed with medication that he was meant to take when he was in the midst of a panic attack. Camryn noted that Landon got addicted to this anti-anxiety medicine, and he was also taking something for his ADHD. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"He depended on those drugs to function," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Camryn then said that she also was dealing with her own depression while she was pregnant, but that things improved for both of them after their second daughter was born. She took a break from YouTube when their newborn bliss wore off.&nbsp;</p><p>The night before Landon took his own life, Camryn said that he apologized to her.</p><p>"I could tell that something was wrong, and he said he was sorry for everything he put me through. It was really hard on me when I was pregnant, and he was heavy in his addiction. He just really wasn't himself during that time. He was just apologizing to me for everything. I could tell he was really putting a lot of blame on himself. I talked to him and I told him I loved him and I forgave him, and that things were different now. We were on a different path," Camryn said.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After that, he said he was going to take a bath. Shortly thereafter, Camryn discovered that Landon had not gone to their bathroom. She soon found her husband in their garage after he hanged himself.&nbsp;He was taken to the hospital, and he passed away less than a week later.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe </a>has been set up for the Clifford family, and at the time of publication, it had raised more than $33,000.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Camryn said that Landon Clifford "died saving the lives of others."</h2><p>After taking a "step back from social media" for her mental health, Camryn returned to Instagram on Aug. 22 to confirm that Landon had died. She posted a photo with her hand on Landon's chest while he was in the hospital. &nbsp;</p><p>"August 13th 2020 was Landon's last day being the best dad and husband he could be. After spending the following 6 days in a coma he passed on and donated several organs to people in need all over the country. He died saving the lives of others. That’s the type of person he was. Compassionate, loving, thoughtful, kind, and gentle," she wrote. "He was an amazing husband and the best father those girls could of [sic] ever asked for."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It saddens me deeply that they will never get to truly know him. He was so young and had so much more life to live. This isn't how things were supposed to go. He was meant to make it to his next birthday," she continued. "He was meant to walk his daughters down the isle [sic]. He was meant to die old with me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Words can not come close to describe the pain I feel. All I can do now is make sure our girls know how much he loved us. He’s looking down on us from heaven and his light will shine through the clouds when we look up at him," she concluded her caption. "May he rest peacefully."<br>Our thoughts are with Camryn, Collette, Delilah, and Landon's other family members at this time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2akkaOxsLqMnJ%2Baq5VisK21xZ%2Bmq5xdmbam</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1188719-nigerian-independence-day-history-top-facts-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Independence day history: top facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./court-sentences-three-gay-men-to-death-by-stoning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Court Sentences Three Gay Men To Death By Stoning</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
