At the time, I waited for the Republicans to say his famous line "you are fired" for him to sooner-than-later bow out of the White House race. But what did we get? Trump ruling the polls, networks, blogs, social media and all,&nbsp;hyping the same garbage Donald's been dishing out. After staying glued to CNN for the past 5months, I am no longer fazed by Donald's constant moronic statements...’All Mexicans are rapist and murderers’, ‘All Muslims are terrorists’, ‘All Migrants are suicide bombers’, ‘Africans are lazy, like to only make love and steal'</i></p><p><i>“His vile verbal and racist assault is endless and yet unrivaled.</i></p><p><i>“Naijas are currently vexing, boiling over in anger following Donald's recent miss-yarns against the black race: “Look at African countries like Kenya for instance; those people are stealing from their own government and go to invest the money in foreign countries.</i></p><p><i>“Truth hurts.</i></p><p><i>“Isn't this the norm with most of our yahoo yahoo rifrafs called leaders?</i></p><p><i>“It doesn't matter if the JACKASS is taking a swipe at Obama because he's from Kenya.</i></p><p><i>“Trump was reported to have said in Indianapolis, U.S. that African Americans were lazy and that Africa needed re-colonisation for 100 years.</i></p><p><i>“Now tell me, with the rate of detoriation of the biggest black nation in the world, are we not beating a retreat to prehistoric times?</i></p><p><i>“Donald Trump said... ‘How do you trust even those who have run away to hide here in the United States, Hiding behind education? I hear they abuse me in their blogs but I don't care because even the Internet they are using is ours and we can decide to switch it off from this side. These are people who import everything, including matchsticks.’</i></p><p><i>“As painfully true as this is, can you blame Donald for his verbal missiles, Is this not our current situation? A country that consumes everything and produces nothing. I guess Donald is washing our dirty linen in public and we deserve it.</i></p><p><i>“When some of our deceitful leaders have destroyed education in this country, where do we turn to?</i></p><p><i>“So much shit is coming out of this guy's mouth that I wonder what comes out of his ass. “Donald will say anything just to get a reaction, forget about the concept of decency. Try talking policies or anything intellectual count the mother f**ker out.</i></p><p><i>“My guts feeling tells me that Donald is being a Jackass/Comedian on propose. The bigger plan is yet to unfold, or is he only having a ball, engaging in masturbation?I see his verbal assault as a strategy; it smells too Naijaish.&nbsp; He may not really have his eyes on the White House per say, but something about making more bucks because he speaks freely what an alarming silent majority feel but won't dare say.</i></p><p><i>“I dey look dem!
