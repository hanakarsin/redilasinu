The man was many things to different people and depending on who you ask, Hugh could be described as a sexual revolutionary or a robe-clad lothario who took advantage of young women. Now, the darker side of Hugh’s life is being explored in A&E’s new documentary series, <a href=#>Secrets of Playboy</a>.</p><p>The show shines a light on the more ominous reality that existed at the <a href=#>Playboy mansion</a>. The shocking details of the many questionable events that took place there have people asking whether the mansion was a full-on cult. But was Hugh a deviant cult leader or just another powerful man exploiting his position?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span><p>Hugh Hefner arrives at London Airport from Chicago with an entourage of Playboy Bunnies</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was the Playboy mansion a cult?</h2><p>A&E’s 10-episode documentary series, Secrets of Playboy, reveals a number of shocking details about what went on behind the gates of the Playboy mansion. One of the biggest bombshells dropped in the series is by former Playmate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holly Madison</a>.</p><p>Holly dated Hugh from 2001 to 2008 and was his main girlfriend at the time, <a href=#>along with Bridget Marquandt and Kendra Wilkinson</a>. Some of their relationship was documented on the reality show The Girls Next Door, which chronicled life as a Playboy bunny.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teaser</a> for the A&E documentary series, Holly gets candid about her time at the mansion and compares it to being in a cult. “The reason I think the mansion was very cult-like, looking back on it, is because we were all kind of gaslit and expected to think of Hef as, like, this really good guy,” the reality star says in the clip. “And you start to feel like, ‘Oh, he’s not what they say in the media, he’s just a nice man.’”</p><p>Holly describes a much less romanticized version of life with Hugh than what was depicted in The Girls Next Door. She describes a world of restrictive rules in which the ladies weren’t allowed to have boyfriends other than Hugh, keep their jobs outside of the mansion, or leave the estate whenever they wanted to.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>“It was so easy to get isolated from the outside world there,” she explains. “You had a 9 o’clock curfew. You were encouraged to not have friends over. You weren’t really allowed to leave unless it was like a family holiday.” Holly also describes how she was forced to give up her waitressing job, which she said she had wanted to keep as her one connection to the outside world.</p><p>Director Alexandra Dean told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Entertainment</a> that the word “cult” kept coming up with different interviewees. She also said that multiple people told her that Hugh had an obsession with the notorious cult leader Charles Manson, who was convicted of killing seven people in 1967, including actress Sharon Tate, who was actually very close with Hugh.</p><p>Some interviewees also revealed that “Hef study[ied] [Manson] home videos… It was like, OK, Hef is intentionally cribbing off of … this control of the women,” Alexandra said. “That’s what we try to show is that there's this thing that Hef does, which is very controlling that he seems to have honed over the decades.”</p><p>Secrets of Playboy airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60edOhnGaonJbGo7vYZqSapqOevK95wGaarqSk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-freitag-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Freitag - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-sydney-on-ncis-los-angeles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Ashley Spillers, the Actress Playing Nell's Sister on 'NCIS: Los Angeles'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
