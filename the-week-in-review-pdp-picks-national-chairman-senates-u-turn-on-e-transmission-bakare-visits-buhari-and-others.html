On contesting 2023 presidency</strong></p><p>Pastor Bakare said he has made his plans known to President Buhari and the details of that particular discussion will remain between them, though he noted he is constitutionally qualified to seek election.</p><p><strong>2. Zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket/power rotation</strong></p><p>He said the debate over zoning/power shift is politically immature. Bakare was of the opinion that the best person should be allowed to emerge.</p><p>He stated that the competence of a leader and what he has to offer should be of utmost importance rather than where he or she comes from.</p><p><strong>3. Introduction of electronic and diaspora voting</strong></p><p>Pastor Bakare commended the National Assembly for allowing the Independent National Electoral Commission to transmit results of elections electronically.</p><p>He however urged that more advanced steps need to be taken by allowing electronic voting and diaspora voting (voting by Nigerians outside the country) also.</p><p><strong>4. Secession threats and agitation for break up</strong></p><p>Pastor Bakare submitted that Nigeria is better as a single entity and those championing a break-up agenda should have a rethink and retrace their steps.</p><p>As a way of curbing the agitations, he called for equity, justice, fair play, and the rule of law in governance.</p><p><strong>5. Restructuring of Nigeria</strong></p><p>The clergy said he totally supports restructuring without violence, adding that it is needed to move the country forward. He argued that restructuring can be achieved in Nigeria without balkanization.</p><h2>EndSARS: Police kick over planned protest</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-345536 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EndSARS-1.jpg alt width=780 height=439 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-345536 class=wp-caption-text>Lagos protest (File Photo)</p><p>Lagos Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, says the command will not tolerate <a href=# rel=noopener>any form of protest in the state</a>.</p><p>Naija News reports that Odumosu made this known in a statement on Monday signed by the state Police Command’s Spokesperson, Adekunle Ajisebutu</p><p>Ajisebutu disclosed that the command had received information of a planned protest to mark one year of the #EndSARS protest.</p><p>He warned that the police would not hesitate to use all legal means to stop the protest from taking place following the experience of the last #EndSARS protest.</p><p><strong>That will be all for this week!
