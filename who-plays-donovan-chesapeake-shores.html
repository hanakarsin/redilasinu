It doesn't help that Donovan, the bandleader Trace opened for on the road last season, is urging him to get back on the road.</p><p>Like Jesse Metcalfe, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Sheridan</a>, who plays Donovan on Chesapeake Shores, is a musician as well as an actor. Read on to learn a little more about the Canadian and where you might have seen him before.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hallmark</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So who is Kent Sheridan, the actor who plays Donovan on Chesapeake Shores?</h2><p>Kent is a Canadian actor of stage and screen, with a resume full of killer roles. And Donovan isn't the first country star he's portrayed. The triple threat has portrayed Kenny Rogers in Legends of Country, a tribute show celebrating the greats of country music.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also tripped the light fantastic in regional productions of shows such as Mamma Mia!, Guys and Dolls, and Grease. Though most of his theater work has been in Canada, he was part of a U.S. tour for Grease.</p><p>On the small screen, you may have seen him in a recurring role on the acclaimed Orphan Black, where he played Conrad. More recently, he portrayed Senator Carlin in an episode of Designated Survivor last season. He has also appeared a few times on the PBS kids' show Odd Squad.</p><p>And if you're a fan of British procedurals, you may have caught him in an episode of Murdoch Mysteries.</p><p>On the big screen, Kent had a small role as a member of the National Security Council in Suicide Squad.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ITV Studios</span></figure><p>Obviously, this season Trace is going to be grappling a lot with whether his love for Abby or his passion for music should take top priority in his life. And while it seems even after performing with Donovan, he's made his choice, I have a feeling he's not done flirting with Nashville fame.</p><p>Of course, in an ideal world he'd be able to have both love and music. Perhaps now that he's back in charge of things at The Bridge, Trace can work on making the Chesapeake Shores club a destination venue showcasing acts like his own band and Donovan's — if only for a chance to hear them perform again together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXZm8r7vVmqVmm5iawKK8xJqinmWjnbyzsdI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-rosemary-kennedy-have-a-lobotomy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A &amp;quot;Forgotten Kennedy&amp;quot; Sister Had a Secret Lobotomy That Led to Years of Scandal and Tragedy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-thomas-jefferson-byrd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Thomas Jefferson Byrd?
