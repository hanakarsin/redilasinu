But many of us are still wondering: Does this all mean that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Legend</a> identifies as a Christian? And what about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen</a>?&nbsp;Does she follow the same religion?&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take a look at the evidence, shall we?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John Legend had a Christian upbringing.&nbsp;</h2><p>When John landed the lead role for Jesus Christ Superstar Live!, he described how his childhood actually helped him prepare for such a huge role. When he was little, John's mother sang and directed the church choir while his grandmother was the church organist. His grandfather was a pastor, and he also had uncles who served as pastors and ministers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By the time he was four years old, he started performing with his church choir.&nbsp;</p><p>The EGOT <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “I was in choir rehearsals every week as a kid, and I took over the choir when I was older. That was the foundation of my career; I wouldn’t be where I am without playing gospel music in church.”</p><p>Aside from growing up on gospel music, John <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that he served as a choir director at Bethel AME Church in Scranton, Pa. for nearly 10 years. Back then, he still went by his birth name, "John Stephens," and he released a few gospel-inspired R&B demos. But it wouldn't be long before he got discovered by music producer Devo Springsteen.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">His Christian background inspired many of his songs.</h2><p>You may have heard the singer's newest song, "Preach," which feels more like a powerful social justice anthem. On Instagram, he detailed how the song was inspired by a certain Bible verse that his pastor once preached on, which was Matthew 22:39.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a>: “I grew up in the church and one of the things we talked about was loving our neighbors as we love ourselves. My preacher told me that our neighbor wasn’t just the person that lives next door to you but other people whom you might not even know.”</p><p>But of course, this isn't the only song that was influenced by his faith. For instance, if you've heard the Oscar-winning hit "Glory" from Selma, then surely you've noticed the song's gospel undertones.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does this mean that John Legend is a Christian?</h2><p>Well, we know for sure that John has deep Christian roots and that what he's learned still influences his work today. The singer did reveal that he doesn't consider himself to be "religious." However, even though he hasn't explicitly labeled himself as "Christian," he mentioned "all of that is still with me."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What religion is Chrissy Teigen?</h2><p>She hasn't publicly labeled herself as a follower of any religion and doesn't consider herself a religious person either. However, she did confirm on Twitter that she's not a follower of Christianity.</p><p>When Chrissy tweeted about her fun weekend adventures, one user asked if Jesus was "shaping her personal culture." And to that, Chrissy essentially responded with a solid no. So it's possible that the model is atheist or agnostic.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButs6hpWaklZyyr7CMnJ%2BroaOptqK6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ja-vonne-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ja Vonne Beard - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./693374-nigerian-entertainer-embarrased-american-presidential-candidate-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charly Boy Slams Donald Trump In New Piece</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
