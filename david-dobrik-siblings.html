Arguably, this might have to do with the style of the content or the geographic distance setting them apart.</p><p>As the kids explained in a previous video, they aren't allowed to keep up-to-date with David's work because their parents think that there's too much swearing involved.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The last time the three kids made an appearance on David's YouTube channel was in a vlog published on Dec. 31, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, the YouTuber and content creator invited his siblings to participate in a Q&A aimed at introducing the viewers to his family background, shedding light on hitherto unexplored aspects of his private life.&nbsp;</p><p>As he revealed in the few-second-long introduction, his favorite sibling is his brother, Toby, who is closely followed by Ester and Sara.&nbsp;Asked about whether there were any perks to having a famous person in the family, the kids jokingly responded with a firm no.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As the girls explained in the video, having David as a brother has its ups and downs.</p><p>Asked about the downsides, the girls named bullying and having to handle people who are more interested in the work of their brother than them. Asked about whether they would choose Jake Paul or David, they pulled a joke on David and named Jake Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>David uploaded a similar Q&A style video to Youtube on Dec. 29, 2016. While he asked questions that were similar in topic and style to those in the other one, the answers he received could not have been more different.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked about the perks of having a famous person in the family, the kids agreed that there are some positive aspects to it. When it came to the hefty subject of crushes, the kids did mention that there were people that they did like. However, they were too cautious to drop names.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although all of the kids have highly popular social media profiles to boast, it's only Ester who gave some thought to following in her brother's footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p>For a short while, she ran a successful Musical.ly page&nbsp;where she posted short, snappy clips involving lip-syncing, dance routines, and some character impersonations. However, she has switched to TikTok since then.&nbsp;</p><p>Although David's siblings rarely feature in the videos, there's no shortage of family-style content.&nbsp;</p><p>The YouTuber regularly refers to the members of his extended friend circle as family. Jason Nash is often labeled as 'dad,' while Lorraine was labeled both as 'mom' and 'grandma' during the brief period the two were married.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmm6iaop64br%2FIm6Oippeo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./222901-finally-jesus-streets-nairobi-speaks-mad-kenyan-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finally 'Jesus' on the streets of Nairobi speaks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yolanda-gampp-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yolanda Gampp - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
