For most of the show, viewers have witnessed several hookups between these two, which led to many fans shipping Lindsay and Carl together. Though they tested the waters in Season 4, things didn't work out at the time due to Carl's battle with alcoholism.</p><p>Fortunately, the pair maintained a friendly relationship, and in October 2021, Lindsay told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that she and Carl "hang out all the time," "live in the same building," and are "really, really close."</p><p>Interesting ... you may be wondering, how close? Well, not only are Lindsay and Carl back together, but they've taken a huge step in their relationship. Keep reading to learn all about their rekindled romance.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carl and Lindsay are engaged!</h2><p>The Summer House couple became engaged on Aug. 27, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported. Evidently, the proposal went down at Southhampton's Dune Beach — and yes, it was filmed for Season 7 of the Bravo show. Paul took Lindsay to the beach under the guise of attending a group bonfire. But when they got there, a picnic was set up for just the two of them.</p><p>"I was so surprised, I'm still in shock!" Lindsay told People.</p><p>"It was quite the whirlwind throwing off Lindsay," Carl added.

"When I'm sober, I'm just very consistent, which is what she needs."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Carl continued to tell Andy, "It's worked out really well. We're in a new space, I'm in a great place. I mean, listen, we have an amazing friendship that has grown so much over these years."</p><p>"But in the last year of my sobriety, my priorities are different, and I just really enjoyed where we are right now. We're having a lot of fun," Carl said before his voice cracked due to nerves.</p><p>He concluded, "We're really happy.
