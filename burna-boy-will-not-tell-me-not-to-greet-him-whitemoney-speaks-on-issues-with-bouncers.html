I’m a huge fan of Burna; I left where I was because I wanted to go and greet him. I asked if I could say hi to burna, and they asked why? That was when I just withdrew, so people thought it was his bouncers bouncing, me, but it was my bouncer that told me, ‘Oga make we comot for here’.</p><p>“I’m not even sure Burna saw me, because I don’t think he’ll see me one on one, and he’ll tell me not to greet him. I know how many times I’ve told my bouncer, let them come greet me, if I lose them, would you pay me?</p><p>“These are the people who put me there. It is people who voted. It’s just like politics; if we vote you, we need access to you so if we vote you and we’ve made you a millionaire and you’re coming out to do buga.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49sZputoqOubq7OsmSwoZyheq%2B702arnqScYrqmec2oq2asn2K0s7HErWShoZ1ixKm1056kqKaVrnq0vMSaoqxln6N6qr%2FSrpysZaeewal5waisp5uVp8Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-american-soul-a-true-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BETs 'American Soul' Tells a True Story With Mostly Fictional Characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tzuyang-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tzuyang - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
