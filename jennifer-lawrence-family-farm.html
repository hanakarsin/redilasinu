The actress grew up on a family farm in Kentucky, and the farm is still run by her family. At the end of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, though, news broke that part of the farm had burned down in a "horrible fire." Thankfully, no people or animals were hurt.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Where is Jennifer Lawrence's family farm?</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer</a>'s family farm is called Camp Hi-Ho, and it's still run by her older brother, Blaine. The farm is designed as an outdoor space for kids and is located in Louisville, Ky. Since Blaine started running it, he's introduced activities ranging from arts and crafts to horseback riding and kayaking. In a post on their Facebook page, the camp announced that the farm's barn had been lost.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm the news that we lost our barn last night in a horrible fire. We are deeply thankful that no people or animals were hurt, but we are still mourning the loss of years of hard work and memories that occurred in these walls,” the post read.&nbsp;</p><p>“Words cannot describe the pain we are in, but we are so incredibly grateful for the Simpsonville Fire Department and all the other firefighters who responded to our emergency," it continued. "You are true heroes. We are also so grateful for the countless members of our community who have reached out to support us during this time.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The statement also reaffirmed that family's faith, saying that they would continue to believe as they began rebuilding.&nbsp;</p><p>"We know Camp Hi-Ho is a special place to so many, and we plan to rebuild and repair so that we can move forward with a safe and joyful camp experience this summer," the statement read.&nbsp;</p><p>Jennifer has yet to comment on the fire personally, but has spoken about the camp in the past, and discussed how important it is as a space for kids to be free and create.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm the news that we lost our barn last night in a horrible fire.

He’s just gonna show up to the camp.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jennifer also marveled at the space that her family has created with the facility. She said it's a place “where kids can do whatever they want. It’s pretty wonderful.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the family is looking to rebuild in the aftermath of the fire. Thankfully, they have a pretty wealthy family member who should be able to contribute to the effort.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusifnKtlnJbEs7HNnJxmnpGitq3FjJ%2BYq6U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frozen-dunkin-donuts-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dunkin Employee Reveals Donuts Are Actually Frozen in Viral TikTok</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-stanley-nwabali-receives-heros-welcome-at-chippa-united-days-after-afcon-final.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stanley Nwabali Receives Heros Welcome At Chippa United Days After AFCON Final</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
