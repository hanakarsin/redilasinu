His name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage but you probably know him better as <a href=#>Joe Exotic</a>. Some of Joe Exotic’s fellow prison inmates tested positive for <a href=#>the new coronavirus</a>, but does he himself have it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joe Exoctic broke many laws that landed him in prison, but did he contract the coronavirus there?</h2><p>The big cat lover is currently serving a 22-year sentence for falsifying wildlife records, violating the Endangered Species Act by killing five tiger cubs, and federal charges for a 2017 murder-for-hire scheme targeting Big Cat Rescue founder, lover of flower crowns, and arch-nemesis Carole Baskin.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>A jury in April found Joe guilty of 21 counts, including plotting to kill a sanctuary owner in Florida who had criticized his treatment of animals, as well as euthanizing the big cats. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, prosecutors said he offered $10,000 to an undercover FBI agent during a December 2017 meeting to kill the animal rights activist, Carole Baskin. “Just like follow her into a mall parking lot and just cap her and drive off,” Maldonado-Passage said in the recording played for jurors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some of Joe Exotic’s prison mates tested positive for COVID-19.</h2><p>Exotic’s fourth husband, 24-year-old bartender Dillon Passage, told Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM radio show that Joe had previously been isolated at the Grady County Jail in Chickasha, Oklahoma, over the coronavirus concerns. The facility is an hour’s drive from Joe’s former zoo, the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, which is featured on the Netflix docuseries.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The facility “put him on COVID-19 isolation,” due to the fact that “the previous jail he was at, there were cases,” Dillon told Andy on his show, Andy Cohen Live.</p><p>Dillon continued, “We speak like three to five times every day, but since he’s been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases...I’ve yet to speak to him since he moved.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The US Bureau of Prisons announced as well that all those currently held in federal facilities approximately 146,000 inmates, including Joe, would be put in quarantine for 14 days.
