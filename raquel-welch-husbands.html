Four to be exact. Before her death, Raquel revealed she didn't regret her marriages even if she didn't get it right when it came to picking a partner.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I never did get it right. And a lot of men don’t like the fact that when we go somewhere I am the one who gets focused on," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Irish Mirror</a>. "I don’t regret the marriages. I had real feelings for all of them. At the time I thought it was love and we could make a great life but it wasn’t in the cards."</p><p>So, who was Raquel married to? Here is a look back at her four ex-husbands.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raquel married her high school sweetheart James Welch in 1959.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Before her first big role in Hollywood, Raquel married her high school sweetheart James Welch, and the <a href=#>couple had two children, </a>Damon and Tahnee Welch.</p><p>They were married for five years before they divorced in 1964. However, she famously kept his last name.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 1967, she married producer Patrick Curtis.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A few years later, she married producer Patrick Curtis. He produced several of her films, including A Swingin' Summer and Hannie Caulder.</p><p>The couple split in 1972 and had no children together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raquel Welch's third husband was producer André Weinfeld.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The third time was not the charm for Raquel, who married André Weinfeld in 1980 before calling it quits after 10 years together.</p><p>“We had a very happy marriage,” André told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a> in 2015, before revealing that distance drove them apart. "She moved back to La La Land and I stayed in New York [City] and Paris... She promised me she would sail into the sunset, and I can see she hasn’t. She married after me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raquel's fourth and final husband was Richard Palmer, a restaurant owner.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Following her divorce from André, Raquel went on to marry one final time. She wed Mulberry Street Pizzeria owner Richard Palmer in 1999, but by 2003, they were officially separated.</p><p>Following their divorce, Raquel vowed to never get married again, and she kept her word.</p><p>"I'm just not suited for it any longer. I love men and I love their company, but I am too independent and self-motivated," she told British Elle, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>. "I'm willing to date but, quite frankly, there is a diminishing group of eligible people at my age. I don't mind the traditional roles of male and female but, as you can tell, I am a very strong minded woman. I'm sure I would be a challenge for an awful lot of men. They wouldn't want to deal with it or, if they would like to deal with it, maybe I'm just not that interested."</p><p>Raquel was rumored to have dated several famous men before she passed away, including TV director Nigel Lythgoe and actor Gary Stretch. In her lifetime, she was also linked to several Hollywood heartthrobs such as Steve McQueen, Elvis Presley, and Warren Beatty — to name a few.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ywcSlZLCdnJi1brTUrJmappSo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./243652-wenye-biashara-ya-ngono-wafurika-kisii-na-nyamira-kuziramba-pesa-za-uhuru-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wenye biashara ya ngono wafurika Kisii na Nyamira kuziramba pesa 'za' Uhuru</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mysticumbreon-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MysticUmbreon - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
