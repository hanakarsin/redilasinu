39 have perished there over the past decade.</p><p>In Indonesia, more than 200 Muslims threw rotten eggs at Christians wanting to hold a Christmas mass outside Jakarta, police said.</p><p>Some 100 Christian worshippers intended to hold a mass near the spot where they hope to build a church, in a project that was barred by district government and community members in 2009.</p><p>Since then, worshippers from the Filadelfia Batak Christian Protestant Church have held Sunday services under scorching sun outside the property.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, local community members blocked the road near the land, local police told AFP.</p><p>Meanwhile in the United States, the organisation responsible for monitoring North American airspace helped with the important task of helping children track Santa Claus’s progress as he completed his whirlwind journey around the globe.</p><p>The Santa tracker set up by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a US-Canada joint operation, said that Father Christmas and his overworked reindeer were resting at the North Pole, having delivered more than seven billion gifts during his annual journey.</p><p>The website, www.noradsanta.org, is available in eight languages and allows children to find Santa’s location and upcoming stops on his trip.</p><p>Also overnight, the pope sent out two tweets, one asking his some two million “followers”: “What are the family Christmas traditions that you still remember from your childhood?”</p><p>In the other, the German pontiff said that nativity scenes bring back fond memories from his childhood in Bavaria.</p><p>The pope has sent out 14 tweets since opening his Twitter account @pontifex in eight languages early this month.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnl8mGploaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-fortnite-creative-2-0-maps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Fortnite' Creative 2.0 is Finally Here Check Out the Best Maps Available</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./462166-photos-buhari-meets-nigerians-in-south-africa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PHOTOS: Buhari Meets Nigerians In South Africa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy;
