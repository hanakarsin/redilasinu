John Akpanudoedehe, in the event that the superior organ of the party, possibly the National Caucus, is unable to meet before January 15, 2022, they should take the path of honour and honourably resign by that date they have not concluded preparations for the Convention and appropriate notice to INEC duly served as required by the law.”</p><p>He said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.</p><p>“Some of the speculations as the reasons for that include the alleged ambition of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni to manipulate his emergence as the substantive National Chairman of the party,”&nbsp;Salihu noted.</p><p>He also challenged Buni to present copies of the membership register to the President and party leaders, insisting that the ruling party is on the verge of crumbling if things do not go on rightly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49xZpqok2KwsLrVnqWtoZ%2BjerOx0qKep2WepMRuu9SrZKmZoqnGbrLUrayrnV2ewG6t02aqrZmbmnqou9WsZJ%2Bnoqq6brDGZquepJyoeq6ty5pkm62ennw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./408589-bushiri-back-behind-pulpit-after-burial-his-daughter-israella-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bushiri Back Behind Pulpit after Burial of His Daughter Israella</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./presidency-defends-tinubu-over-sons-inclusion-in-delegation-to-qatar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Presidency Defends Tinubu Over Sons Inclusion In Delegation To Qatar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
