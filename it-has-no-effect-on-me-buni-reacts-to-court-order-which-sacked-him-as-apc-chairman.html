Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national Caretaker committee, <a href=# rel=noopener>Governor Mai Mala Buni</a> has declared that the court order which purportedly sacked him from office is of no effect on him.</h2><p>Governor Buni in a statement on Thursday by his media aide, <strong>Mamman Mohammed</strong> observed that the court order is restricted to the leadership of the APC in Delta State and not the national leadership of the party.</p><p>It will be recalled that a&nbsp;High Court sitting in Asaba, Delta State on Wednesday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>restrained the interim chairman</a></strong> and others from parading themselves as members of the party’s CECPC until the determination of a substantive suit before the court.</p><p>The presiding judge, <strong>Justice Onome Marshal Umukoro</strong>, in his ruling on Wednesday also stopped the Party’s scheduled LG Congress in Delta State slated for September 4, 2021.</p><p>The Deputy Chairman of the party in Delta State, <strong>Olorogun Elvis Ayomanor</strong>, had led other officials of the party in the state to the Court, challenging the outcome of the Ward Congress in the State.</p><p>However, Buni in his reaction through the statement by his aide said the court ruling only affects the forthcoming ward Congress Delta state and does not affect other states.</p><p>It, therefore, urged those termed as mischief-makers in the statement to stop twisting the court order to suit their own purposes.</p><p>Below is the full statement as made available to <strong>Naija News</strong>.</p><p>“Mr Elvis Ayomanor and seven others on 19th August instituted a case against the APC and its leadership in a Hogh Court of Justice, Asaba, Delta state, challenging the outcome of the party’s ward Congress of 31st July, 2021.”</p><p>“The seven applicants prayed the court to among other things issue and service the originating summons on 15 defendants including the party, the Chairman Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and members as well as, the Chairman of the party in the state.”</p><p>“The applicants also sought the court to issue interim injunction to restrain the chairman and members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from acting or parading themselves as leaders of the party pending the determination of the case against the outcome of the ward Congress in Delta state before the court.”</p><p>“They also prayed for interim injunction restraining the party from conducting the local government and state government Congresses slated for 4th September in Delta state pending the determination of the case before the court.”</p><p>“The High court in its wisdom ruled “This court has looked at the motion Ex-Parte dated 18th/8/2021 and filed 19th/8/2021seeking the reliefs as set out on the face of the motion paper. This court has also looked at the supporting affidavit along with exhibits attached as well as the written address containing legal arguments in support of the prayers sought. Reliefs 1, 2, 3 and 4 have to do with issues of service of processes on all parties in this suit. Relief 5, 6 and 7 are injunctive reliefs being sought in the interim.”</p><p>“The affidavits in support contain sufficient grounds for the grant of the reliefs being sought. Reliefs 1,2,3,4 and alternative prayer 5 of the motion Ex-Parte are hereby granted. Alternative prayer 5 is granted only in relation to the 15th defendant (Jones Ode Erue, Chairman APC, Delta State). In compliance with order 39 Rule 7(3) of the Extant Civil Procedure Rules of this court, this order of injunction granted shall abate after 7 days. It shall not operate ad infinitum. This matter stands adjourned to 7th September, 2021 by 10.00 a.m on agreement of counsel”.</p><p>“From the above, it is apparently clear that the court ruling only affected the15th defendant (Delta state Chairman of APC) and not the National Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Yobe state Governor Hon. Mai Mala Buni and other members of the committee.”</p><p>“It is also clear that the restriction of the forthcoming ward Congress is limited to Delta state and does not affect other states.”</p><p>“Some mischief makers who never wished the party well, had continued to misrepresent the facts mostly without having access to the court ruling.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49rZqKsXZ2utHnNqGSenpaasLV5zqdkpp1dl8KvtYyrnJqbpKh6tbuMnKauqqRivLOwxKtksKCZmLVuv8Ccop6cXZ22rnnArGSaqJNisKmtyKukmqZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-vasquez-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Vasquez - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./faith-thigpen-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Faith Thigpen - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
