If, as Atiku believes, the average Northerner needs a Northern President now, after a Northern President, when will they ever not need a Northern President? What does Atiku think the average Southerner needs? Why is it about what the average Northerner needs, or even what the average Southerner may need?</p><p>“Why is it not about what Nigeria and Nigerians need? Nigerians need bold and visionary leadership anchored on a firm commitment to transcendental national unity, over and above ethnic or sectional obsessions. Atiku’s words ring loud of extreme and mindless desperation, and such an extremely desperate man cannot and must not be entrusted with the most important job of President – a job whose core duty is that of leading, uniting and working in the best interest of all in an ethnoreligious pluralistic society as Nigeria. Our country does not need this kind of highly inflammable rhetoric now or ever.”</p><h2>Atiku Has Let The Cat Out Of The Bag</h2><p>The ruling party said further that the PDP presidential candidate who has been parading himself as a unifier has finally let the cat out of the bag with his ‘unfortunate’ statement.</p><p>“Our Northern citizens and patriots know far better than what Atiku thinks, and will not walk down that slippery slope with him.</p><p>“Atiku seeks to inflict on Nigeria discord and strife of a worse kind than he has inflicted on his PDP. Against the dictates of his party’s constitution on the principle of power rotation between and North and South of Nigeria, Atiku wrested Presidential Candidacy and left his party in fractious disability,”&nbsp;the statement said.</p><p>It added: “In direct contrast to Atiku’s schismatic tendency, our Northern Progressive <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>APC</strong> </a>Governors stood valiantly in support of the emergence of a Southern Presidential Candidate of our Party in demonstration of patriotic commitment to national unity, equity and fairness. That is what Nigeria needs, now and ever.</p><p>“And that is the commitment that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, our Presidential Candidate brings in his aspiration to serve as President. As Governor of Lagos State, his executive cabinet was a rare and admirable reflection of ethnic and religious diversity.</p><p>“We are confident he will enthrone equity, fairness, inclusion, and unity as operating national policy when elected as President in next year’s general election, as we urge Nigerians to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BvZqGdXZ7AbrDErKeeqpGpsm6tz5xkn6GimsBurdOioq5ln6uys3nNqKmtoJWnu6a%2B0mabqGWepMFuusSem2axn6fCo62Mop6bp12Yrq%2BwyJ2YrZ1dmLyuucSnq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-makes-peanut-butter-bday-cake-then-uninvites-allergic-nephew.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Makes Peanut Butter Cake for Daughter's Party, Uninvites Allergic Nephew Is She in the Wrong</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-no-nigerian-politician-as-performed-well-like-kwankwaso-galadima.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023: No Nigerian Politician As Performed Well Like Kwankwaso</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
