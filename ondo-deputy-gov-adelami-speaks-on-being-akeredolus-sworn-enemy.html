style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Ondo State Deputy Governor, Olaide Adelami, has debunked purported claims that he is a sworn enemy of the late state governor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rotimi Akeredolu</a>.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Adelami made the clarifications while reacting to a report allegedly sponsored by a faction within the Ondo State All Progressives Congress, APC, caucus at the green chamber of the National Assembly, the House of Representatives.</p><p>The deputy governor, in a statement signed by his spokesperson, John Paul Akinduro, alleged that some aggrieved representatives wrote a letter to President Bola Tinubu claiming that Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa had made several decisions indicating his animosity towards the late Akeredolu while labelling Adelami as a sworn enemy of the late Akeredolu.</p><p>Adelami asserted that the malicious statement is untrue and a mischief by the aggrieved ‘honourables’.</p><p>Adelami recalled how he provided the late Akeredolu with financial, political, and spiritual support during the electioneering campaigns that resulted in his first and second terms in office.</p><p>The statement read, “The repeated fallacy that His Excellency, Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa hobnobs with Late Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s sworn enemies is becoming excessively irksome and prattle.</p><p>“Ordinarily, we would have ignored this utter hokum, but it is imperative to set the record straight for the reading audience, especially seeing a recent publication by some section of the media, where what appears like a splinter group of the Ondo state All Progressives Congress (APC) caucus in the House of Representatives, purportedly wrote a letter to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, alleging that the new Deputy Governor of Ondo state, His Excellency, Chief Olayide Adelami, mni, was a sworn enemy of Late Governor Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, SAN, CON.</p><p>“For the avoidance of doubt, this concocted and malicious statement is not only untrue in its entirety but a mischief by these ‘honourables’.</p><p>“Chief Adelami was never an enemy of the late governor nor any other political player in Ondo state or elsewhere. The Deputy Governor is a decent politician and philantropist with verifiable track records.</p><p>“It is instructive to note that Chief Adelami has always been a strong member of the APC and staunch supporter and dependable ally of late Governor Akeredolu for eons.</p><p>“Worthy of mention is the fact that the deputy governor gave moral, political and financial support to the late governor during the electioneering campaigns, leading to his first and second terms in office and, subsequently rendered same support all through his tenure as governor of Ondo state.</p><p>“It is also remarkable that after losing the governorship primaries to late Arakunrin Akeredolu, SAN in 2020, Chief Adelami joined the campaign train and walked alongside with the late governor as he moved round the 18 Local Government Areas of Ondo state. Clearly, this cannot be the same Adelami and Akeredolu the misleading statement described as ‘they did not see eye to eye’</p><p>“On record, was the donation of 5,000 copies of the APC constitution to the party, branding of Face caps and T-shirts with the inscription ‘Adelami Support Group for Aketi’, among many other items, which were received by the party chieftains, led by the State Chairman, Engr Ade Adetimehin, to support the re-election campaign of the late governor in 2020.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5ByZqimlKR6pbHPrquyZZekw26tw56jmqWZYsCxscCkqmannmKvprXNoGSao5WnsqW7y66qZqunpL%2BvecSnnKaxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-marie-tendler-taylor-swift.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Marie Tendler's Joke Accusing Taylor Swift of Plagiarizing Her Art Backfired</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inec-released-timetable-schedule-of-activities-for-bye-elections-re-run-elections.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>INEC Releases Timetable, Schedule Of Activities For Bye-elections, Re-run Elections</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
