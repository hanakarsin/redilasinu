It's even worse when the property managers of the place you're residing in won't respond to repair requests or does a shoddy job of maintaining the premises.</p><p>However, there are some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tenants who are nightmares to deal with</a>; those who take advantage of local laws to not pay their rent or cause undue damage to the properties they live on. And then there are some who think that they've got way better design choices than the folks who own said properties and decide to implement those design choices.</p><p>Now if you're renting out a unit, common knowledge is to design it in an aesthetic that's as neutral as possible so that it appeals to the largest demographic of folks as possible. And it looks like Jeff, who posts on TikTok under the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@its_principle</a>, showed off a place that's put together in a manner that's in accordance with this philosophy.</p><p>The tenant in question, however, apparently holds a different belief when it comes to interior design.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@its_principle href=#>@its_principle</a><p>Part 2. <a title=landlord href=#>#landlord</a> <a title=tenantsfromhell href=#>#tenantsfromhell</a> <a title=landlordspecial href=#>#landlordspecial</a></p><a title="♬ Oh No - Kreepa" href=#>♬ Oh No - Kreepa</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>Jeff shows off some "interesting" choices of fixtures and tacked-on decorations that were slovenly applied to the walls throughout the living space, complete with before and after photos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>First, there's a room with grey walls and a dark-colored carpet. Clean white paint accents the windows providing a nice contrast to the walls. The tenant's thought it would look better with a greenish coat of paint and what appears to be a bunch of sheets of paper glued to the ceiling, with some added metallic-looking cog decals plastered on the walls.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>They seem to have also added a hanging fixture that looks like a bunch of cotton balls smashed together in the hopes of resembling a cloud. Faux brick wallpaper was also added to various halls throughout the house, but the brick is glossy giving it an aesthetic like it just rained or it was covered in Vaseline because who doesn't like the look of slimy brick?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>In the walls of the stairwell, there's an added cog on the wall theme, along with more faux-brick face in another room, however, it's of a more reddish vibe, rather than brown and tan tone.</p><p>For some reason, the bottom portion of the wall that meets the stairwell has more faux-brick wallpaper, but it looks like whoever was decorating the apartment ran out of materials.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>Because then it just transitions to white paint with smears of a darker color running alongside it. This goes all the way to an upstairs room which features more faux wall fixtures: this time they opted for a metallic bracket look but it appears they couldn't settle on the color. Some of the panels are grey, and the others are half-painted white.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>The clip then cuts to a variety of different items/materials left behind by the tenants, including a horror-filmed theme movie poster that looks like it was randomly glued to the bottom of a wall. The most bizarre addition looks like a fake dungeon door with a sign that reads: New York Insane Asylum above it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>TikTokers who saw the post speculated, as they did from previous posts from Jeff, that whoever was living there was running some type of escape room business.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>However, there were some folks who didn't have any sympathy for the landlord, stating that, "anything that makes a landlord regret becoming a landlord is a win in my book"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @its_principle</span></figure><p>What do you think? Should tenants not be allowed to do such major re-designs without consulting their landlord? Or is that what deposits are for?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aotNOmmKudXamyr63NrWSdnZOkv6LAxKxkpZmembmwvsNmmKmZoqm6prrT</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-charge-psvr2-controllers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Charge PSVR 2 Controllers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./406780-sauti-sols-bien-narrates-traumatic-time-he-was-hit-by-car-nairobi-cbd-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sauti Sol's Bien Narrates Traumatic Time He Was Hit by Car in Nairobi CBD</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
