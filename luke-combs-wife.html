And did they really get married in a hurricane?</p><p>Read on for everything we know about Luke Combs' wife, their kids, and how she's continued to inspire his music.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Luke Combs' wife? He married Nicole Hocking in 2020.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, it was Nicole's job that brought her and Luke together. Nicole has been working for Broadcast Music Inc. as a recruiting coordinator. The pair had mutual friends and were dating other people when they first met, but slowly began to grow together.</p><p>Luke wrote his first song about her, "Beautiful Crazy," before they even started dating officially!</p><p>"Iâ€™m not much of a ladiesâ€™ man," he said. "But I was pretty proud of this one. I had written it, maybe two days before [I played it for her]." The pair officially started dating in 2016.</p><p>At a singer-songwriter festival in Florida, Nicole happened to be in attendance with a group of friends and spotted Luke alone on the street. Nicole invited Luke to join them, and the rest is history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Luke did admit that in the beginning, he could see why people assumed their relationship wouldn't work. His career was just getting off the ground in 2016, while Nicole had graduated college with a degree in civil engineering. However, when Luke's music career began to skyrocket, Nicole took two years off work to support him.</p><p>"I stayed home for two years pretty much as his career was growing and growing, and I wanted to be there for all those first moments," she said.</p><p>Although their engagement was a little rushed â€” he proposed on their kitchen floor â€” their wedding ceremony was filled with excitement. The couple got married with the threat of a hurricane on Aug. 1, 2020. Despite the potentially dangerous weather, Luke and Nicole looked gorgeous. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram photo</a> documenting the occasion, Luke wrote, "Yesterday was the best day of my life. I got to marry my best friend. I love you Nicole, hereâ€™s to forever."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Luke and Nicole welcomed their first child, Tex, in 2022 â€” and are now expecting baby No. 2!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Combs ðŸŽ¤ (@lukecombs)</a></p></figure><p>Luke and Nicole shared the exciting baby news on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, captioning a reel of themselves and their son, Tex Lawrence wearing a big brother onesie, "Joining the 2 under 2 club!
