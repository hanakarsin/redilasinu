If you remembered how busy he was after that visitors, members of government, various personalities, so it was not possible for me to be able to see him.</p><p>“After the time I had to travel abroad but from broad he was able to reach me on my birthday and after that interesting social media report that I was dead. “But when I came back I made a number of efforts but unfortunately I think because of his busy programme it was not possible for me to see him.</p><p>“ But luckily enough, this time he was able to give me the opportunity to see him and to discuss various matters especially the issue of the ECOWAS problem at the moment which I think needs to be resolved. And being the surviving leader, or founding fathers of the ECOWAS I think we had to discuss some of his plans in order to see what can be done to bring the matter under control. So, this is what has brought me here and we had a very interesting meeting.</p><p>“And I’m sure some of you have read report that I refused to attend ECOWAS conference isn’t it? Is it you that did that report? Who did that? You know trying to give that impression that it was me who was probably trying to sort of sabotage ECOWAS. No, that is not the case.</p><p>“I think there was a miscommunication but then it gave the opportunity for Mr President to call me so that we can discuss what I was to do.</p><p>“So that ECOWAS meeting was part of the discussion we had today. So that has been done and solved and I hope that we can probably be able to have that message done later on today at ECOWAS headquarters probably by 5pm they will let you know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FqZrKZm6qvtnnGqK6opl2nsrexwKWqZqyYmnq1vtStn2aZkqTCtXnRnqGem6Seu6h5xJymsJmjYravwsitmK2hn6N8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
