You'd be excused if you'd need a refresher on past events.</p><p>Luckily, we've got you covered on the specifics. Check out our recap of the major events of Mob Psycho 100 to prepare yourself with keeping up with Season 3.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's our recap of the first two seasons of 'Mob Psycho 100'.</h2><p>Mob Psycho 100 follows the tale of middle school student Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama. Despite his polite and unassuming demeanor, he is an incredibly powerful psychic. His powers are linked to his emotional state, so he keeps his mood stagnant as often as possible. But every so often, he becomes overwhelmed by certain emotions, manifesting in explosions of power. He works as an assistant to Reigen Arataka, a con man posing as a spirit medium who leads Mob to actual spirits for him to exorcise.</p><p>In the first season of Mob Psycho 100, Mob attempts to fit in at school and lead a normal but fulfilling life. Meanwhile, he continues to work for Reigen to exorcise spirits. One of Mob's mission leads him to exorcise a high-level spirit known as Dimple. Dimple then assumes a smaller and weaker form and becomes Mob's companion.</p><p>All the while, he encounters psychics like Teruki "Teru" Hanazawa who challenge him for his power.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Mob eventually manages to make friends at school, but his actions inadvertently grab the attention of rival schools as well as an evil organization of psychics known as "Claw." Agents of Claw manage to kidnap several young psychics, including Mob's brother Ritsu who had awakened to his own powers.</p><p>Mob and his new frenemy Teru manage to rescue the kids from Claw. Mob and Reigen even manage to take down one of their division leaders.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Whereas Season 1 saw Mob learning to accept his powers as a part of him, Season 2 went even more introspective. Throughout the season, Mob encounters other psychics who force him to confront his own feelings. Up until this point, Mob has always feared letting his overwhelming emotions fuel his powers. He eventually learns that letting himself feel his feelings allows him to process them in more healthy ways. He even builds a more honest relationship with Reigen.</p><p>But Claw soon returns, making even bigger moves than before. The organization's leader and all-powerful psychic, Toichiro Suzuki, is gearing up to destroy the city in his bid for world domination. Mob and his friends team up once more to stop Toichiro from enacting his plans. After a long and difficult battle, Mob is able to talk Toichiro down from his plot. However, their psychic battle resulted in the growth of an immense broccoli plant dubbed "the Divine Tree" by the city.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The all-new season sees Mob at a crossroads in his life. As Mob prepares to graduate middle school and enter high school, his friends begin discussing what they want to do with their lives. Mob begins to struggle with that answer himself.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new cult revolving around Mob's actions begins to surface, and Dimple appears to be making moves on his own now as well.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Mob Psycho 100 every Wednesday on <a href=#>Crunchyroll</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyjec%2BssJygn2J%2BcXyMq5ycmaA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./havan-flores-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Havan Flores - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./306153-2015-buhari-declares-presidency-abuja-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2015: Buhari Declares For Presidency In Abuja</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
