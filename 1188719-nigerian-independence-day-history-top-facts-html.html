Due to the specific features of the African technical and cultural development, most tribes could not oppose Europeans with their guns, war ships and other weapons. This is why the locals were eventually subdued by white colonial powers quite easily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6sg551apani.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> When was Nigeria amalgamated and by who?</p><p class=align-left>Colonization on the continent brought many cultural effects. Local religions, traditions and culture were oppressed and replaced by European ones.</p><p class=align-left>No wonder that one day local tribes started to think of freedom. Actually, the very first day of the colonization was the beginning of the rebellion. It grew for many years until there appeared strong spirits who were able to lead others and conduct the struggle for freedom.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/610d8690fa832599.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lai Mohammed: Increase in electricity, fuel prices will benefit ordinary Nigerians later</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Somewhere between 1922 and 1959 Nigerians began to agitate for freedom after so many years of the British rule. Some famous and courageous men started struggling for the awakening of the Nigerian national spirit. It was an unexpected turn for the British colonists and they started to think about the ways of regaining control over the colonized lands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/610d8690fa832599.jpeg><p class=align-left>For instance, they created several new constitutions that were supposed to calm down people’s rebellious moods. However, all these steps were not effective enough to make people forget about their life under the colonial rule and calm down their intention to have freedom.</p><p class=align-left>On October 27, 1958, the United Kingdom came to a conclusion that it would be better for Nigeria to become an independent state. At midnight on October 1960, Nigeria became independent and a new flag was created to replace the Union Jack. The national anthem was changed, too. “God Save the Queen” was no longer welcomed. It was replaced with “Nigeria We Hail Thee.”</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/1b96d1892c11df87.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60 prominent Nigerians to be honoured at Nigeria's 60th anniversary celebration</span></p></a><h2>The new rule after Nigeria independence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt24ls6keb1m8.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nigerian heroes and their contributions</p><p class=align-left>The first Prime Minister after the Independence of Nigeria was Abubakar Tafawa Balewa.

The pre-historic tribes developed in their own way, gradually forming up the current ethnic groups, which can be met in Nigeria today.</p><p class=align-left>Before the British came and colonized the land, there were several independent kingdoms and states.
