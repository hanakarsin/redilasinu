In his letter to Titus, Paul the Apostle says that women are expected to love their husbands and children, be pure-minded, self-controlled, care for the home, and be kind and dutiful to their husbands.</p><p class=align-left>The verse, Titus 2:4-5, reads:</p>Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ec9804516475d4e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 Bible verses about marriage that will inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is an essential Bible verse about mothers, as it speaks about their role in society. In the same message to Titus, the Greek word <i>"phileoteknos"</i> appears. The term refers to a mother's love, which is different from all other types of love.</p><p class=align-left>The essence of this love is in taking care of the children, supporting them, bringing them up as good people, embracing them when they feel alone, and helping them get through hard times.</p><h3>Bible quotes about mothers</h3><p class=align-left>What does the Bible say about mothers? And what are their roles towards their children? Here is some scripture about mothers' responsibilities towards their children:</p><h4><strong>1.
