And there are some foods that suffer from this a bit more than others. You'll probably tolerate drunkenly scarfing down dinosaur chicken nuggets that have a bit of freezer burn.</p><p>But if you're paying for a baked good at a retail chain with the name of said baked good in its branding, then maybe you'd want that baked good to not be frozen then reheated for your consumption.</p><p>At least that's how a lot of commenters felt when a viral TikTok demonstrated how Dunkin' Donuts employees prepare their donuts for the day.</p><p>And they aren't freshly baked.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@sophiafischett href=#>@sophiafischett</a><p>Come work 2 jobs with me!

My life has been a lie," one user said. Another remarked, "Hold up, (you’re) telling me the donuts in the morning aren’t fresh made?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sophiafischett</span></figure><p>Fischett explained that making them fresh in house would probably be impossible due to the high volume of donuts that are being sold, not to mention that the entire "reheating" process itself takes anywhere from 3 to 5 hours.</p><p>And while there were a lot of people who were genuinely distressed to learn that Sophia was taking donuts out of a freezer to reheat in an oven, there were other folks who weren't really all that surprised.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sophiafischett</span></figure><p>One user penned, "The fact people actually think the donuts are made there. I find better donuts at the gas station tbh."</p><p>But other commenters said that the mass freezing and reheating of donuts happened some years ago and that the baked goods used to make every single one of them fresh every day.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sophiafischett</span></figure><p>"My uncle owns several DD’s in the North. The donuts used to be made fresh everyday but that changed many years ago. Now they are made somewhere else."</p><p>So do you feel a little bit more validated now when you swore that the donuts there just didn't taste the same anymore? Will this change your mind about buying donuts from the coffee shop giant? Or will you still eat them anyway?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7%2BwxsSnZJ2tnqC2r3nDqKWurKNiwaq306ii</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karragen-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karragen - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lawrence-family-farm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Jennifer Lawrence's Family Farm?
