Mostly because you're still (probably) very much a child. You're still raising your hand to ask if you can go to the bathroom. You still probably can't get a credit card in your name, and you wouldn't even be able to book a hotel room or rent a car without some kind of crazy <a href=#>cash deposit</a> and/or someone else signing off as a guarantor.</p><p>Naturally, you're going to look to your superiors for some guidance/tips on how to best go about your work duties at this first job. So if you end up working under a team that is less than helpful, you're more than likely going to have a bad time and develop some pretty unhealthy and ineffective work habits under their tutelage.</p><p>And if you're managers/management team bully and harass you, well, that's going to make everything just that much worse. This is apparently what happened to a 16-year-old Wendy's employee who confided in her mother that she was being harassed at work by her manager.</p><p>This obviously didn't sit well with her Mom, who decided to take things into her own hands and speak with the manager at the Wendy's location her daughter worked at.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lpeezy312 href=#>@lpeezy312</a><p>I don't play wit no one when it comes to my kids!

Others also remarked that they experienced similar treatment at the hands of managers while working jobs as a teenager, and that a culture of "bullying the young" exists at some of these establishments.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lpeezy312</span></figure><p>However, there were also some commenters who remarked that her going to her daughter's job would only further complicate matters for the teen at the workplace and that the young woman would ultimately have to learn how to fight her own battles and stand up for herself without parental intervention.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lpeezy312</span></figure><p>User @lpeezy312 added that she's not a fan of confrontation and only really gets involved in her daughters' personal lives unless she deems an intervention as absolutely necessary: "She tried to handle the situation but they intimidated her. This my daughter first job ever. My daughter is a minor. My baby never had a physical fight in her 16yrs of her life."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lpeezy312</span></figure><p>What do you think? Did the TikToker handle the issue in the best way possible? Or do you think that folks need to be thrown into the proverbial fire and learn to figure things out on their own without their parents stepping in to "save" them?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyuecKopZ%2Bqn6PBtHnWnqWdsaNiuqK6wKCcqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-yobe-north-senatorial-candidate-senate-president-lawan-loses-in-court-as-machina-is-declared-winner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Senate President Lawan Loses In Court As Machina Is Declared Winner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-vasquez-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Vasquez - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
