On the surface, it seems to be a small, independent brand — and it certainly started that way. <a href=#>Founder Wally Amos</a>, who was also a musical talent agent, a literacy advocate, and more, would send his home-baked cookies to desired clients in order to entice them to join the agency he worked at.</p><p>Later, at the advice of some of his famous friends who loved his baking, he started the company in 1975 in Los Angeles. <a href=#>Marvin Gaye</a>, who was one of the musicians that Wally represented, even helped him get started with a financial loan.</p><p>However, in the almost 40 years since the brand's inception, it has blossomed into a <a href=#>multi-million dollar venture</a> and been acquired multiple times. Who owns Famous Amos cookies now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Wally Amos and his wife.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who owns Famous Amos cookies? The brand has changed hands several times.</h2><p>Amos's small business boomed almost immediately, reaching a revenue of around $12 million by its seventh year, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>. This led them to branch out into supermarkets, where the cookies are mostly found nowadays. However, sales began to slow a few years after that, and Amos was forced to sell a portion of the business to Bass Brothers Enterprises, who were unable to get the company back on track.</p><p>In 1988, the entire brand was sold to the Shansby Group, a private equity firm based in California, and for the first time, Wally acted as a paid spokesperson instead of the company's leader. He quit after only one year, per the New York Times.</p><p>Since then, the company has changed hands several times: Famous Amos was sold to the President Baking Company by Shansby in 1992; the President Baking Company, who also made Girl Scout Cookies, was purchased by Keebler in 1998; then the Kellogg Company purchased Keebler in 2001.</p><p>As of 2019, Keebler and its subsidiaries — including Famous Amos — have been sold by Kellogg to the Ferrero Group, the maker of Nutella. Because Wally was no longer a part of the company, his death will likely not affect the brand in any way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec6wpaxllpa6sMHSZpimp6NisLC7yqKcrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./401937-william-rutos-camp-attracting-leaders-criminal-tendencies-otiende-amollo-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>William Ruto's camp is attracting leaders with criminal tendencies, Otiende Amollo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-barats-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Barats - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
