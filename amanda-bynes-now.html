To be clear, she wasn't funny for a kid or hysterical for a girl, Amanda is objectively funny. Her delivery is superseded only by her physical comedy, the likes of which haven't been seen since Lucille Ball shoved candy down her shirt in I Love Lucy. In the entertainment industry, it's widely understood that comedic actors can usually tackle drama flawlessly. Amanda has definitely brought tears to our eyes either from laughter or heartbreak.</p><p>Since her meteoric rise to fame as a child star and then as a young adult in films like What a Girl Wants and She's the Man, Amanda has struggled with her health. She has been <a href=#>in and out of treatment facilities</a> where she was addressing addiction and mental illness. In March 2024, Investigation Discovery released a docuseries that chronicled the alleged abuse on the sets of various Nickelodeon shows, including All That. Here's what we know about the allegations as well as where Amanda is now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Amanda Bynes now? She is pursuing her nail technician license.</h2><p>According Amanda's Instagram, she enjoys announcing projects but rarely appears to see them through. In a video from October 2023, Amanda revealed that she was working on a coffee table book with her friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Sieminski</a>. The former actor announced there was a "top secret photoshoot in L.A.," for this book that was happening Oct. 27, 2023. She then invited people to text her for more information. Amanda popped back onto Instagram a few days later to say the shoot went well. We haven't heard anything since.</p><p>Less than a month after the coffee book idea was shared, Amanda dropped a video about starting a podcast with Sieminski. "It's super impressive that Paul's going to be a part of it because he's a scientist and a biochemist," said Amanda. The first and only episode was released on YouTube on Dec. 11, 2023, and featured tattoo artist Dahlia Moth.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>In a series of Instagram Stories that have since expired, Amanda told fans the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast was canceled</a>. "The 1st episode of my podcast did really well. I was actually surprised and of course was going to keep going after friends encouraged me to ... After thinking about it, though, I would rather get my manicurist license and have a consistent job," she wrote. On March 5, 2024 Bynes shared a photo of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Barbering and Cosmetology exam results to her Instagram stories.</a> Sadly she failed, but promised to "study harder next time."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Allegations of abuse on the set of 'All That' are detailed in an Investigation Discovery docuseries.</h2><p>In Investigation Discovery's Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, new details about Nickelodeon show creator <a href=#>Dan Schneider</a> are disturbing. The first show he created for the network was The Amanda Show, which ran from 1999 to 2002. From there, Amanda co-starred in the WB's What I Like About You with Beverly Hills 90210 alum <a href=#>Jennie Garth</a>. Scheider was the co-creator but his time with Amanda contributed to her filing for emancipation from her parents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Writers on the show All That, which featured Amanda in Seasons 3–6, claimed there were sexually charged acts and writing in the sketches. For example, Brian Peck (who sexually abused <a href=#>Drake Bell</a> when he was a child) played a character called Pickle Boy. That character carried around the phallic food on the fake set which often made the cast and crew uncomfortable.</p><p>The docuseries goes deeper into the inappropriate and at times disgusting environment that Scheider was apparently fostering on the sets of shows where children were usually the main cast members. While Amanda has never said anything publicly about Schneider, one has to wonder how much of her time on these shows contributed to her issues later in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqiusOaZJuxnprAbrrOsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-houdini-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Houdini - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./final-fantasy-14-16-crossover-leaks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Final Fantasy XIV' x 'XVI' Crossover May Be Coming Sooner Than Expected</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
