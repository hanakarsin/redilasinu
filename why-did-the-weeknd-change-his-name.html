Why the switch? Let's unpack the change in his moniker.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It goes without saying that <a href=#>The Weeknd</a> is one of the most successful crossover artists of a generation. His impressive discography spans pop, rap, R&B, electronic music, and more. Now, the singer, born Abel Tesfaye, is looking to move into yet another new era of his career. Only this time, he's looking to shed the name The Weeknd for good.</p><p>Indeed, it appears as though the artist will no longer be releasing music as The Weeknd, but why? What will his new name be? Keep reading for all of the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did The Weeknd change his name?</h2><p>In a May 2023 interview for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a> alongside his <a href=#>The Idol</a> co-star Lily-Rose Depp, The Weeknd explained that he's looking to "kill The Weeknd" and reinvent himself as Abel Tesfaye.</p><p style=text-align:start>"I‚Äôm going through a cathartic path right now," he told the publication. "It‚Äôs getting to a place and a time where I‚Äôm getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter. I‚Äôll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I‚Äôm definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn."</p><p>The star also noted that his next album will likely be his "last hurrah as The Weeknd."</p><p style=text-align:start>"This is something that I have to do," he added. "As The Weeknd, I‚Äôve said everything I can say."</p><p style=text-align:start>Neither The Weeknd nor his team have elaborated any further on the details of his name change.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans react to the news that The Weeknd wants to go by 'Abel Tesfaye.'</h2><p>Naturally, an artist with as much star power as The Weeknd changing his name is bound to shake up the music conversation. In the time since it was announced that The Weeknd would eventually be no more, users online shared their own takes on the situation and what it means to them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The assistant in the record store when I ask if they have any Abel Tesfaye albums in stock. <a href=#>https://t.co/ldCzMH0frO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bDUKAzkBEs</a></p>‚Äî Stuart (@st_ua_rt) <a href=#>May 15, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>oh no‚Ä¶.

He originally wanted to be known as The Weekend but took out the "e" because the Canadian band The Weekend already exists. The Weeknd revealed all those years ago that, "I hated my name at the time though so I tried it as a stage name. It sounded cool. I took out the 'e' because there was already a Canadian band named the weekend (copyright issues)."</p><p>The Weeknd also discussed his origins as an artist, sharing that he left home after dropping out of high school in order to pursue his music career. He said, "I left home when I was about 17 dropped out of high school and convinced Lamar to do the same lol. We grabbed our mattresses from our parents threw it in our friends s--tty van and left one weekend and never came back home. It was gonna be the title of HOB ['House of Balloons']."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>This Reddit AMA is probably one of the most personal moments <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weeknd</a> has ever had with fans. However, he did also give a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> where he touched on his evolution a bit more. "You could hear the vulnerability in the music before, but there was such a shield, such a f--k you to the world, and now I‚Äôm very comfortable with letting the world know that I can be that way," he said of how things have changed for him sonically over time.</p><p>The Weeknd also discussed his upbringing during that chat. "Ethiopian ‚Äî Amharic ‚Äî was the first language I learned to form sentences in because my grandma, who raised me with my mom, would not speak English. Because of television and being in Canada, I learned English too, but I went to French-immersion school, where you‚Äôd get in trouble for speaking English, and I couldn‚Äôt speak it to my grandma, so it‚Äôs almost like English is my third language, even though now it‚Äôs my first," he shared.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The singer even dove deeply into what led him to drop out of school and pursue music. He said, "It was tough growing up where I was from. I got into a lot of trouble, got kicked out of school, moved to different schools and finally dropped out. I really thought film was gonna be my way out, but I couldn‚Äôt really make a movie to feel better, you know? Music was very direct therapy; it was immediate and people liked it. It definitely saved my life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asmJp6uLHEpKWdZZOdrq%2BzxGafoqtdo66usQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./318849-mp-babu-owino-finally-shows-face-handsome-son-kenyans-t-calm-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MP Babu Owino finally shows face of handsome son and Kenyans can't keep calm</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./difference-between-3d-and-hfr.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>What Is the Difference Between 3D and HFR Formats?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
