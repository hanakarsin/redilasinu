I mean, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statistically speaking</a> there's a good chance you won't be with that person for very long, but still, you want your wedding day to go perfectly.</p><p>But if we learned anything from romantic comedies and honestly just life in general, it's that worst case scenarios usually find a way to disrupt our lives, even on a day as magical as our wedding. The nerve, right?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>As horrifying as it is to even think about, there are plenty of people who were willing to share their own "wedding fail" moments. All they needed was the nice guy charm of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Fallon</a> to get them to share them with the rest of the internet.</p><p>Like this Dad Joke with possibly the worst timing ever.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>After my dad walked me down the aisle, but before he gave me away, he asked my fianc√©e ‚ÄúDid you bring the money?‚Äù <a href=#>#WeddingFail</a></p>‚Äî tina dawson (@tina_como) <a href=#>May 15, 2018</a></figure><p>This dude who ruined the vow exchange by blasting some RiRi.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My phone began to play ‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äù by Rihanna and Jay Z at full volume right before the kiss.
