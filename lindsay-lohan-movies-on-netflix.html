But with this millennial icon's <a href=#>return to acting</a>, the people have spoken and could not be more excited for her return.</p><p>We quickly watched Lindsay in <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s <a href=#>Falling for Christmas</a> and loved every minute, but one movie just isn't enough to cure our craving. Thankfully, Lindsay signed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a two-movie deal with Netflix.</a> Her next film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Wish</a>, is already in post-production.</p><p>In the meantime, we pulled together a round-up of Lindsay's movies and where to watch them while we (not so) patiently wait.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Sick Note' (2018)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sky UK</span></figure><p>While this isn't a movie, it is a Netflix original and it does star Lindsay, so we say it counts.</p><p>Sick Note is a British dark comedy. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">logline</a> reads, "When Daniel Glass is misdiagnosed with a fatal disease, he begins to notice how everyone around him treats him better, so he decides to keep pretending that he really is sick.
