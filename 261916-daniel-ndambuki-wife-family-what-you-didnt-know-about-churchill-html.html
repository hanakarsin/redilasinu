He was born in Kutui, but his parents moved to Machakos. The father of Kenyan comedy, as he is referred to by many, has been in the industry since 1996 and has grown to be a household name in the country. The comedian launched the comedy show Churchill Live in September 2008. However, in its third season (2012), the show changed its name to Churchill Show.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Comedian Churchill Ndambuki forced to speak after aroused photo goes viral</p><p class=align-left>Up to now, the show has offered an opportunity to hundreds of Kenyan comedians to showcase their talent and earn from the same.
