And though a graduate of Sociology and Anthropology, she said her initial dream was to become a lawyer before things went otherwise.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Actress Foluke Daramola-Salako Attacks Men On Rape</p><p><i>“</i><i>I was born and bred for a while in Lagos but I am from Anambra State.</i></p><p><i>“I grew up in a family of seven and I had a good upbringing. My parents are staunch Catholics. I attended Queens School, Enugu and studied Sociology and Anthropology at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka.

She blames the fact of practitioners not getting enough reward for their efforts on piracy and inadequate distribution channels among other things.</p><p>According to her, she got full support from her parents upon starting as an actress after which she vowed to uphold the family’s good name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6fth7mp1d3k.jpeg><p>On her good looks, she said: <i>“I just exercise once in a while.
