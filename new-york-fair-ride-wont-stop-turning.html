Another person asks if they can "pull the plug," and a park employee turns around and informs them that there isn't a "plug" to disengage.</p><p>Then, a man can be seen walking up the ramp to step into the ride area. They open the gate and head inside, followed by another man with a bag — they appear to be maintenance workers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kinggee_654</span></figure><p>"This is why you don't get on these rides," someone can be heard shouting off-camera as the two employees get to work on stopping the ride. A third person with a bag on their back walks up to the control panel for the attraction to join the other workers.</p><p>"That's crazy. That's a lawsuit. That's a lawsuit," the same man could be heard shouting, as he interacts with another bystander who says that they'd been on the ride for at least 10 minutes.</p><p>Within seconds, the maintenance workers are able to shut the ride down. The lights turn off and the passengers on the ride begin to slow down as folks surrounding the attraction begin to clap.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kinggee_654 href=#>@kinggee_654</a><p><a title=ryeplylandridemalfunction href=#>#ryeplylandridemalfunction</a> <a title=wow href=#>#wow</a> <a title=thiswhyidontrideonrides href=#>#thiswhyidontrideonrides</a> <a title=malfunction href=#>#malfunction</a> <a title=nogoodride href=#>#nogoodride</a> <a title=wepaytomuchforentranceforthistohappen href=#>#wepaytomuchforentranceforthistohappen</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#FYP</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=viralvideos href=#>#viralvideos</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kinggee_654" href=#>♬ original sound - Kinggee_654</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @kinggee_654</span></figure><p>In a follow-up video, ride passengers exit the attraction, children can be seen crying into the arms of adults outside of the ride, as the man off-camera loudly urges folks to file "police report[s]" while also stating that he would never get on another ride again.</p><p>One commenter who saw the video joked that they couldn't understand who the police report would be served to: "a police report we gonna arrest the ride for assault??"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kinggee_654</span></figure><p>While another highlighted how upset one of the passengers exiting the ride looked: "Bro with the red shirt and the chain turned backwards mind went back in time on that ride he got off wanting to fight everybody"</p><p>Another expressed their disgust that the first thing folks started talking about after seeing the ride was worrying about getting a lawsuit and not fearing for the safety of the children on the ride.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kinggee_654</span></figure><p>"People thinking lawsuit lol instead of being grateful kids are safe lol," they wrote.</p><p>And then there were those who were surprised that the passengers on the ride weren't worse for wear upon exiting the attraction: "How in the world was anyone walking after that straight"</p><p>Another said: "I’m shocked no one threw up or passed out that ride already goes fast"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7K4edioqaRllpa2s3nRopueZaeku7V50q2mqWWkqr%2Bvtc2g</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-bts-lives.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BTS's Lavish Seoul Estate Is One of the Most Exclusive Compounds in South Korea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1332755-rhea-perlman-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-children-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rhea Perlman bio: age, height, net worth, husband, children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
