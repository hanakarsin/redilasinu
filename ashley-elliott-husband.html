The internet can be a thin veil for folks who post about their lives and offer peeks into their personal space, and depending on the kind of content that you share, it can be difficult to maintain a sense of anonymity. Anyone who wants to become an influencer should bear that in mind, especially if they have loved ones who may not feel the same way. Just ask <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Elliott</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In case you haven't heard of her, Ashley Elliott is a popular make-up influencer who has amassed a massive following since arriving on the internet in 2019. She typically shares tips and tutorials on hair care, make-up, and has even launched her own brand of hair gel called Combat Gel. As of this writing, her YouTube channel has over 2 million subscribers and her <a href=#>TikTok</a> has a staggering 14.5 million followers. However, recent developments have had fans wondering about Ashley Elliott's husband.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened with Ashley Elliott's husband? Here's what we know.</h2><p>Folks have been worried about Ashley ever since she vague-posted about marriage on Aug. 24. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">short TikTok</a>, she expressed her general fear of getting married to a hard-working man who makes great money and supposedly wants to take care of you to the point where you don't work yourself. She goes on to hypothesize the idea of that husband leaving her for someone younger down the line, essentially abandoning her without any way to make it on her own.</p><p>Immediately, folks started to connect this to her actual husband. They were left wondering if Ashley had been going through this exact scenario herself.</p><p>She subsequently posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up</a> to try and allay people's fears, suggesting that this was purely a hypothetical scenario and that she was not going through that with her own husband.</p><p>Despite this, people also noticed two auspicious events that coincide with this marriage scare.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For starters, fans noticed that she is no longer wearing her wedding ring. Secondly, all of the videos on the socials that featured her husband have been removed. People have been drawing their own conclusions, but Ashley posted one more video to address these incidents. She explained that the two of them have had different stances when it came to being on the internet.</p><p>"I've always loved being on social media and he did not," she stated.</p><p>While Ashley was content enough to keep posting couples content as she gained popularity over the years, she stated that her husband "doesn't want to be recognized every single time he goes out in public." While she herself has accepted the life of a public influencer, she has seemingly respected her husband's wishes for him to not share in the spotlight.</p><p>As for the absence of her wedding ring, Ashley herself has declared that she wants to keep that issue private for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCpuMSyZJ6knJ68tcCMoaysmpGjsQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./12-gemini-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>12 Year Old Geminis | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sah-babii-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SahBabii - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
