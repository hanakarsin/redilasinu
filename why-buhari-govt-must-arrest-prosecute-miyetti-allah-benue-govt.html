If anyone is guilty of profiling the Fulanis, Miyetti Allah and the other groups fit that bill.</p><p>“Governor Ortom has no personal issues with Fulani. Some of his friends of many years are Fulani, and he also has some appointees of Fulani ethnicity.</p><p>“The Governor is only against the attacks on his people by Fulani who come from neighbouring countries such as Niger, Chad, Mali among others.</p><p>“He owes no one apology for choosing to stand with his people in resisting those whose only agenda is to take over and occupy Benue lands.</p><p>“The Fulani groups consider themselves above the laws of this country.</p><p>“This is why they boldly issue directives, threats and make hostile comments on sensitive national issues believing that the Federal Government or anyone else can do nothing to stop them.</p><p>“Now they are calling for the establishment of a Ministry of Nomadic Affairs. Perhaps their next demand will be for the creation of a Nomadic state where only pastoralists will live.</p><p>“If the Federal Government is serious about ending banditry in this country, it should order the arrest and prosecution of leaders and members of Miyetti Allah groups.</p><p>“They have questions to answer regarding the armed herdsmen who have taken over the country’s forests and have been attacking innocent Nigerians.</p><p>“It is pertinent to state once more that no amount of hatred or media attacks can force the repeal of the Benue State Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law.</p><p>“Anyone who intends to breed animals in the state must do so in compliance with laws of the state.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49rZrCgqWKvtrTAq6Bmn5%2BrwW651KyrZpmip7K0wIypqairlZjCtbGMpqCynaSptm6ty6WYoWWSmru2sYygpq%2BsXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./again-davido-fingered-in-another-baby-daddy-scandal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Again, Davido Fingered In Another Baby Daddy Scandal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./312883-uhuru-maintains-government-money-increase-allocation-counties-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uhuru maintains government has no money to increase allocation to counties</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
