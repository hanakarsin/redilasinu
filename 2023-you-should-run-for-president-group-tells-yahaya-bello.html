He added that the Kogi governor is the right leader who “will lead the birth of a new Nigeria”.</p><p>He opined Bello is a visionary youth with proven track records of performance, and one of such is refusing to lockdown Kogi state during the first covid-19 lockdown, which has in turn increased investment in Kogi state by N1 billion ahead of Lagos state.</p><p>Ghadaffi said that Nigeria needs a visionary leader like Bello who will dare to change the status quo and deliver modern security and protect the lives and properties of Nigerians at any given time.</p><p>He disclosed that Bello is the most suitable leader to occupy Aso Rock in 2023, adding that the group is willing to purchase nomination forms for him.</p><p>He said: “Alhaji Yahaya Bello is the most favorable for the office of the president, coming from a geo-political zone (North-Central) that has never produced a democratically elected president in democratic Nigeria.</p><p>“What Nigeria needs at this moment in time is security and Governor Yahaya Bello has demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that he has the capacity to deliver modern security and protect the lives and properties of Nigerians at any given time.</p><p>“Governor Yahaya Bello is a visionary youth with proven track records of performance, and one of such is refusing to lockdown Kogi state during the first covid-19 lockdown, which has in turn increased investment in Kogi state by N1 billion ahead of Lagos state.</p><p>“Kogi state tertiary institutions are in session, graduating students while their contemporaries are at home for over a year. It takes a man with courage and doggedness to achieve these feats in the face of crisis militating against economies and governments, Umar reiterated.</p><p>“Nigeria needs a visionary leader, who will dare to change the status quo. Governor Yahaya Adoza Bello has proven this, times without number. First was having the political will to sanitize a civil service that was polarized with ghost workers.</p><p>“Secondly, it is on record that Yahaya Bello boldly said that top politicians were the ones frustrating the security efforts of the president and lastly he has maintained his position on COVID-19 and criticized even the amount set aside for the purchase of vaccines which is running into over N560 billion which he opined can build over 40 world-class, state-of-art health centers all around Nigeria that will cater for and proffer solutions health issues without recourse to travelling abroad.</p><p>“Along with global trends of Youth taking over leadership, Yahaya Bello is the youngest governor in Nigeria today who without a godfather was able to build political relevance within his short stint in politics across ethnicity, religious and political divides.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49rZmtoYmh6urvUZqqhp6WhsW6%2B1Kdkn6eiYr2zsdKim56mpGK0s7vUqWStnZyhwG7FwKGYspldl7KtuM5o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./former-sierra-leone-president-koroma-arrives-nigeria.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Former Sierra Leone President, Koroma Arrives Nigeria For Medical Care</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-saturday-5th-february-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Saturday, 5th February, 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
