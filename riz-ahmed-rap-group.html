In fact, his interests extend into other creative outlets, such as being a member of a <a href=#>rap group</a>. The British-Pakistani actor, who garnered the attention of the prestigious award show for his role in Sound of Metal, captivated fans by portraying a musician and recovering addict who loses his hearing.</p><p>Although the latter two elements are (thankfully) not true parts of his life, the musician aspect is, and Riz runs with that mentality in his lauded role. So, how has Riz's rap group affected his career as a whole, and what place does it have in his life now? Here's an analysis of the impact of his group, the Swet Shop Boys.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Riz Ahmed's rap group, the Swet Shop Boys, is the product of a longtime love for hip-hop.</h2><p>The Wembley, U.K. native has been building a following alongside rapper Heems as the Swet Shop Boys. The group was founded to offer a fresh take on hip-hop music with the added spin of addressing issues prominent within their own ethnic groups.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2005, while he was still getting his feet wet in the industry, Riz actually won a series of U.K.-based rap competitions. He took part in the likes of Hit & Run night in Oxford, the&nbsp;Jump-Off, Battlescars, and DJ Nihal’s Bombay Bronx.</p><p>Alongside Heems, the Swet Shop Boys became a phenom in their own right. Their 2014&nbsp;"Swet Shop EP," in-part inspired by Hindi language as well as&nbsp;Sufi poetry, garnered them a niche following that they have enjoyed ever since.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Swet Shop Boys are known to tackle racism within their songs.</h2><p>One of the most prominent elements of their music and the reason why they were able to gain traction in the hip-hop world is their constant references to issues experienced by those of the same ethnicity as them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Swet Shop Boys (@swetshopboysofficial)</a></p></figure><p>Although the Swet Shop Boys have made activism a core element of their sound, their take on the genre as a whole still sounds fresh and different. With releases such as "T5," "Zayn Malik," "Shottin," and "No Fly List," they dance between traditional hip-hop tropes and genuinely fresh perspectives on issues impacting other minority communities not usually represented through hip-hop.</p><p>During a chat with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talkhouse</a>, Heems summed up the group's goals rather well. He claimed that the group came together due to "the differences in diaspora, and how to connect these diaspora dots, and the differences in diaspora in America and England. Latinos in America are like South Asians in England—this idea that our blood built these bricks."</p><p>Although it has been some time since the group has shared any new content, here's to hoping there are some new tunes released in the future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7a7ecChpJ6cXaeusXnGq6auqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sergio-pettis-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sergio Pettis - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paulina-char-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paulina Char - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
