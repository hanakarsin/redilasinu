Was it all a big joke?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Artist <a href=#>Anna Marie Tendler</a>, the former wife of comedian <a href=#>John Mulaney</a>, recently made a joke that wasn't received all too well. On TikTok, Anna made a bold statement about <a href=#>Taylor Swfit's</a> set design for <a href=#>the Eras tour</a>, which kicked off on March 17. Long story short: Anna's video caused a huge commotion amongst Swifties. What did she say in it? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anna Marie Tendler accuses Taylor Swift of plajarizing her artwork.</h2><p>"My girl. People who designed Taylor's tour. This setup looks strikingly like one of my photographs in tone and aesthetics," said Anna in her now-deleted TikTok. Anna first showed a clip of pre-recorded footage of Taylor by a table that had played during the Eras tour. Then she showed her sold-out piece, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Dinner in March,"</a> which is priced at $5,000.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/sunsabun</a><p>Anna Marie Tendler claimed that the left image, resembled her art work, which is seen behind her in the right image.</p></figure><p>Anna continued: "Um, it doesn't totally feel like parallel thinking to me. I'm a small artist, an independent artist who is trying to make money and live off of my artwork. I don't know what to do about this, and maybe someone can help me."</p><p>Swifties were not pleased with Anna's remark. "Like, this has to be satire right? She can’t seriously be accusing Taylor Swift of stealing her idea of setting a table," wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one user</a>.</p><p>It wasn't long before Anna deleted the video and made her account private — but it was already too late. A screen recording of Anna's TikTok was making the rounds on the internet, confusing viewers alike.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> was even created to discuss Anna's video.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>One user wrote that Anna accusing Taylor of copying her art was "embarrassingly delusional." Another user added: "It's a dinner table, yo. This barely qualifies as similar, let alone plagiarism."</p><p>Trying to clear her name, Anna took to the comment section of a TikTok video where her deleted video continued to be shown via screen recording: "Hi! This was meant to be a joke. Most of my videos are jokes or satire! When I realized it wasn't landing as a joke, I deleted it. Didn't mean offense."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>After Anna's statement, her fans even took to her defense. "It’s a joke! That’s just her sense of humor, I’m like 99.9 percent sure she’s a Swiftie, and she is NOT a small artist," opined one.</p><p>Still, others were unable to wrap their heads around Anna's joke explanation. "Yeah right, LOL," wrote one user. Others joked that Anna had "really poor humor."</p><p>So, was it actually a joke? Taylor's fans don't think so. Hopefully, if Anna ever makes another joke about Taylor, she'll run it by a Swiftie first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruvrYymmKuhlWLBprrDpZyrZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-alaskan-bush-people-scripted.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Alaskan Bush People Scripted?
