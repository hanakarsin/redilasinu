I do all of those things enough, so when he's around, I defer those responsibilities. And one woman on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, @Cadyeds, whose name is Catherine, seems to get that better than most. Because in a recent video, she shared that she doesn't know how to open her <a href=#>gas tank</a> because her husband usually fills her car with gas when needed.</p><p>I understand her dilemma to an extent. But if my car needs to be refueled, I have no issue filling it up myself instead of waiting for my husband to take care of it on his own time. In the video, Catherine explains that she has found herself in a sticky situation â€” not only is she not used to filling up her tank, but she can't even figure out how to open the fuel door to her gas tank.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok / @Cadyebs</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman shared in a TikTok that she doesn't know how to open her gas tank.</h2><p>Catherine starts her TikTok video off by sharing a text on the screen that says she was "majorly humbled today." She then explains that she looked around her car for a button to open her gas tank so she could get gas, but she can't find any lever or button to pull or press to access her fuel cap.</p><p>As someone who has a fuel door that you simply push on to open it, I understand her confusion. And she has a pretty upbeat attitude about it, too.</p><p>"Major first world problem right now," Catherine says in the TikTok. "I do not pump my own gas and I cannot tell you how to open my gas tank right now. But I am, like, I will not make it home."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cadyebs href=#>@cadyebs</a><p>The ending ðŸ¤£ Raphael please never divorce me, im nothing without you ðŸ¥¹ <a title=girlproblems href=#>#girlproblems</a> <a title=marriagehumor href=#>#marriagehumor</a> <a title=husbandsoftiktok href=#>#husbandsoftiktok</a> <a title=cartok href=#>#cartok</a> <a title=q8 href=#>#q8</a> <a title=marriedlife href=#>#marriedlife</a> <a title=wifelife href=#>#wifelife</a> <a title=vlog href=#>#vlog</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=dayinmylife href=#>#dayinmylife</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Catherineebs" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Catherineebs</a></figure><p>She then points out the buttons near her front driver's side door for the trunk and hood of her car, but nothing that indicates how to access her gas tank to fill it up. But it doesn't take her long to figure it out once she realizes there is, in fact, no button.</p><p>Catherine gets out of the car and decides to "just press it" and when she presses on the fuel door, it opens. I mean, it's the small victories for me. And although Catherine may still opt to have her husband fill up her tank in the future, at least she now knows a little more about her car.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok / @Cadyebs</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She also put the wrong kind of gas in her car, apparently.</h2><p>Once Catherine figures out how to open her gas tank, she realizes that she doesn't quite know which kind of gas to put in it to make it the most fuel-efficient. She eventually chooses a simple unleaded gasoline. However, as a few people in the comments under the TikTok tell her, the Audi Q6 she's driving actually requires premium gas.</p><p>Another comment, however, commended Catherine for learning something new: "I love the learning experience, we all start somewhere. Yesterday I changed my windshield wipers for the first time!" And you have to hand it to Catherine for never giving up in the face of car-related adversity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok / @Cadyebs</a></figure><p>And for what it's worth, others have had the same issue as Catherine involving opening the gas tank door.</p><p>"The same thing happened to me a few weeks ago," someone wrote under the TikTok video. "Not me panicking, calling my husband, sweating, asking how to open the tank."</p><p>For Catherine, this may very well be the start of something new in the form of understanding her car better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mm6ido6PBbrfNqK5moJ%2BserW7jKinnqZdnK60edOapaQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kill-these-kidnappers-bandits-you-are-arresting-pastor-enenche-tells-security-agencies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Kill These Kidnappers, Bandits You Are Arresting' Pastor Enenche Tells Security Agencies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./win-win-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>WinWin - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
