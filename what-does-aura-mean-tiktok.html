Recently, TikTok users have begun tracking something called their aura, and have even suggested that there's some sort of point total associated with the metric.</p><p>If you've found yourself confused by the constant references to a person's aura, then you aren't alone. We've got you covered with everything you need to know about what auras mean on TikTok, and why they're suddenly everywhere.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does aura mean on TikTok?</h2><p>A person's aura refers generally to something close to their "cool points." Basically, if their aura counter is high, it means they have a lot of swagger, and if their aura points take a hit, it's because something fairly uncool has happened to them. The trend suggests that there are a whole variety of activities that gain and lose you aura points, and they're probably the kinds of things you'd expect.</p><p>If someone holds the door open for you, you gain some aura points. If, on the other hand, you think there's an extra step on the stairs that isn't there, or you try to shake hands with someone who is going in for a fist bump, you lose points. These are the kinds of social situations that many people are already familiar with. All that's different now is that TikTok has created a point system to quantify exactly how cool or uncool something is.</p><p>As is the case with most things on TikTok, the points themselves aren't really the point. Instead, the point is to come up with things that might gain or lose you points. There's no one system here that has a 10,000-point maximum, for example. It's all relative, and the trend is really about identifying the various cool or awkward things that happen to a person in daily interactions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@sambramlett0 href=#>@sambramlett0</a><p>Bud isnt recovering from this one<a title=adamsilver href=#>#adamsilver</a> <a title=nba href=#>#nba</a> <a title=basketball href=#>#basketball</a> <a title=capcut href=#>#capcut</a> <a title=auralost href=#>#auralost</a> <a title=aura href=#>#aura</a> <a title=capcut href=#>#CapCut</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Sam" href=#>♬ original sound - Sam</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Don't take the aura thing too seriously.</h2><p>Typically, users will track their aura points during an entire day, but once again, the actual numbers shouldn't be taken all that seriously. Instead, it's just a fun way to keep track of all the ways you make yourself look either cool or like a fool during a day. If you're clumsy, you're probably going to end up in the negatives, but that isn't the only way to lose points.</p><p>Basically, auras are exactly what you might expect them to be. They aren't as mystical as the definition of that term usually is, but they nonetheless involve something that you can't directly see, but that you carry around with you all day.</p><p>If you feel like participating, it's as simple as paying closer attention to how much swagger or foolishness you engage in during a given day, and getting it down on video. If you feel like things won't go your way, maybe find another TikTok trend to participate in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZbCs62Mppyapl2ptqzAzqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tv-stars-who-dated-in-real-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Times a Behind-the-Scenes Romance Impacted an On-Screen Couple (And Vice Versa)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nollywood-actor-turn-amputee-seeks-financial-help.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nollywood Actor Turn Amputee Seeks Financial Help</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
