She was confirmed as third-party candidate <a href=#>Robert Kennedy Jr.</a>’s running mate on March 26, 2024.</p><p>Kennedy may have selected Shanahan as his vice presidential pick due to her proximity to power in the tech industry. And the deep, deep pockets in tech. What's Nicole Shanahan's net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Nicole Shanahan's net worth?</h2><p>It has been widely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Shanahan is worth between $5 million and $6 million, but she may be a billionaire. Her 2023 California-based divorce from the 10th richest person in the world, Sergey Brin, was settled in confidential arbitration.</p><p>Shanahan was married to the Google co-founder from 2018 until their divorce in 2023. Brin’s net worth is reported to be $120.4 billion. Many details of their divorce were kept private.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Nicole Shanahan</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">Lawyer, technologist, third-party VP running mate</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> 5 million to 6 million</p><p style=text-align:start>Nicole Shanahan is the running mate in Robert F.

The court filings emphasize Brin and Shanahan's desire for secrecy around the proceedings, and they have attempted to have much of the case placed under seal. "Petitioner is a co-founder of Google and one of the wealthiest and most famous technology entrepreneurs in the world. Because of the high-profile nature of their relationship, there is likely to be significant public interest in their dissolution and child custody issues," a filing from Brin's lawyers reads.</p><p>The story got much juicier a month later when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported on June 25, 2022, that the dissolution of the union stemmed from an affair between Shanahan and Musk, who happens to be a former friend of Brin. Shanahan and Musk denied the report.</p><p>Shanahan spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> for a July 6, 2023, interview. She said, “My career has been based on academic and intellectual credibility, and I was being shamed internationally for being a cheater. To be known because of a sexual act is one of the most humiliating things ... it was utterly debilitating.”</p><p>Later in the piece she says, “Did Elon and I have sex, like it was a moment of passion, and then it was over? No. Did we have a romantic relationship? No. We didn’t have an affair.”</p><p>On Sept. 15, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> reported that the divorce was finalized on May 26, 2023. On March 26, 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> reported that Shanahan sought $1 billion from the divorce.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Nicole may be a billionaire, or billionaire adjacent due to her second ex-husband, but she was doing just fine before him.</h2><p>Shanahan graduated from Santa Clara University School of Law in 2014 After law school she became the founder and CEO of legal tech company ClearAccessIP, a company that used AI to help speed up the patent process. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> the company to a competitor, IPwe, in 2020.</p><p>In addition to working in tech, Shanahan has worked in film as an executive producer for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiss The Ground</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolver</a>. She’s also a member of multiple boards: Carbon Royalty Corp, Extreme Tech Challenge, and the Sloomoo Institute.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why did RFK Jr. chose Shanahan as his VP?</h2><p>When speaking about the circles that Brin, Musk, and Shanahan ran in, it makes a lot of sense for a spoiler candidate to pick her. “There’s a community of friendship involving not just Sergey and Elon but many other people in the tech world — investors, founders, really big thinkers, dreamers, and doers. Elon was another person in this group of people. There’s almost this generational ecosystem and it’s a community. You run ideas past each other and you ask questions."</p><p>Whether Shanahan had a romantic relationship with the third richest person in the world doesn’t matter. She still knows Musk. She still shares a child with the 10th richest person in the world. Just knowing those men may help Kennedy fund his third-party bid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aku8ueZKygkaOuqa3NZqWerF2svLPAxw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roosmarijn-kok-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roosmarijn De Kok - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-huckabee-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Huckabee - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
