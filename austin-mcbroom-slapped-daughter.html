"I understand that but the way he looked at her and say ‚Äúgahdamn‚Äù was kinda creepy to me," one concerned viewer tweeted before another added, "the way the little girl pushed his hand away from her butt too...."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Austin McBroom (Ace family) smacking his daughters butt.. they need to be canceled <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eLZ52VK3Y1</a></p>‚Äî Tiannaüåà (@tianna_lipscomb) <a href=#>July 18, 2020</a></figure><p>Austin started being accused of predatory behavior towards children, with some social media posts even pointing out that he's done similar things with his wife's younger sister.&nbsp;</p><p>In another video, he brought the child to a sex toy shop and bought her a lollipop that was shaped like a penis.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't help matters either that <a href=#>Cole Carrigan</a> released a video on YouTube that delineates a list of <a href=#>sexual assault claims against Austin</a>. The clip was titled, "The Truth about the Ace Family" and has since been deleted and Austin responded online by stating that the clip was defamatory and he'd be pursuing legal action against Cole.&nbsp;</p><p>Many believe that the video's disappearance is directly linked to that legal action.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Catherine with her brother Ryan and sister Valentina in 2014.</p></figure><p>Austin's Twitter response is still on the internet where he posted screenshots from his phone app stating:</p><p>"If you‚Äôve not heard, I have recently been a victim of extortion, defamation, and slander.
