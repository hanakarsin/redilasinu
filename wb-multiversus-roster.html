While Shaggy takes on opponents with sandwiches and Scooby Snacks that are typical of his character, he can also charge up punches and energy for superpowered combos. That's right, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra Instinct Shaggy</a> is now part of the world of fighting games.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bugs Bunny</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.

As a venerable wolf of Winterfell, she wields her trusty Needle to dance like water around her enemies.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jake the Dog</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.

This is apparent in movesets, music, and above all, voice acting! Many characters in MultiVersus are portrayed by their original actors, be they recognizable voice talents reprising their roles to actual live-action actors returning to bring life to their iconic characters. Here's who's in the cast so far.</p><p>(Bold denotes an actor reprising their roles)</p><ul><li><strong>Kevin Conroy as Batman</strong></li><li><strong>George Newbern as Superman</strong></li><li>Abby Trott as Wonder Woman</li><li><strong>Tara Strong as Harley Quinn</strong></li><li><strong>Matthew Lillard as Shaggy</strong></li><li><strong>Eric Bauza as Bugs Bunny and Tom & Jerry</strong></li><li><strong>Maisie Williams as Arya Stark</strong></li><li><strong>Jeremy Shada as Finn the Human</strong></li><li><strong>John DiMaggio as Jake the Dog</strong></li><li>Daniel Divinere as Steven Universe</li><li><strong>Estelle as Garnet</strong></li><li><strong>Jim Cummings as Tazmanian Devil</strong></li><li>Iron Giant as Johnathan Lipow</li><li>Andrew Frankel as Reindog</li><li><strong>Kate Micucci as Velma</strong></li><li>John Eric Bentley as LeBron James</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here are the characters we want to see in the game soon, starting with Animaniacs.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>The <a href=#>Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister</a> are three agents of cartoon chaos wrapped up in adorable little packages.
