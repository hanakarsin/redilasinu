In a TikTok video, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laugh Hard @laughhard__</a> shared a video of a couple who barged into a random home without reason.</p><p>“At least he was polite after noticing he was wrong. What would you have done?” the creator captioned the video.</p><p>As the video starts, you hear a loud noise and see a man who is out of the frame standing at a front door.</p><p>“What the f---?” a man questioned.</p><p>“This is not the right house, this is not the right house,” the resident shouts at the man.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“B-------, where is he?” the enraged father asked.</p><p>“Who are you looking for?” the man in the home asked.</p><p>A woman can then be heard saying, “Let’s go, the cops will handle it.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After the man asked who they were looking for, the woman said, “Your brother.”</p><p>The man explained that he doesn’t have a brother.

While some folks in the comment section poked a little fun at the situation, the consensus is that the man was simply doing his duty as a father.</p><p>“Yo, at least they sincerely felt bad and left money to fix the damages, that’s protective parents,” one person commented.</p><p>“He’s just a father trying to protect his daughter,” a person chimed in.</p><p>“I wouldn’t press charges. He is just being a father. He admitted the wrongdoing and emptied his wallet. He was so sorry,” another person shared.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Don’t get it twisted, we understand parents wanting to protect their child or even want some retribution on a person that has hurt their family. However, you can’t go around breaking into a home — which is a crime by the way — to seek justice.</p><p>The only saving grace is that the couple was extremely apologetic and took accountability for their misstep. That said, it’s clear that the man who wronged the couple’s daughter is in for a rude awakening.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vecGrnJqjo2K2r8DOZq6rp56ceqm71Kyc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./406780-sauti-sols-bien-narrates-traumatic-time-he-was-hit-by-car-nairobi-cbd-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sauti Sol's Bien Narrates Traumatic Time He Was Hit by Car in Nairobi CBD</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./betty-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Bettys | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-armed-robbers-attack-aso-rock-target-buharis-chief-of-staff-residence.html>Armed Robbers Attack Aso Rock, Target Buhari's Chief Of Staff Residence</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./416462-didmus-barasa-atamatisha-likizo-ampigia-debe-mgombea-wa-uda-kiambaa-html.html>Didmus Barasa Atamatisha Likizo, Ampigia Debe Mgombea wa UDA Kiambaa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carole-baskin-granddaughter.html>Don Lewis's Granddaughter Isn't a Fan of Carole Baskin Here's Why</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yakubu-gowon-reveals-the-truth-about-rejecting-ecowas-invitation.html>Yakubu Gowon Reveals The Truth About 'Rejecting' ECOWAS Invitation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./412747-matokeo-ya-juja-kando-rais-uhuru-apiga-luku-kali-wakati-wa-ziara-lamu-html.html>Matokeo ya Juja Kando, Rais Uhuru Apiga Luku Kali Wakati wa Ziara Lamu</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
