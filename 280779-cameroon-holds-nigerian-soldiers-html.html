Col. Didier Badjek, as saying the soldiers had been disarmed and were now being accommodated in schools.</p><p>As at the time of compiling this report, the Nigerian military authorities are yet to confirm or deny this claim.</p><p>Reports had informed earlier on Monday that the Boko Haram insurgents had captured Gamboru-Ngala, a key town on Nigeria border with Cameroon part of Borno State after fierce fighting between men of the Nigerian Army and the militants.</p><p>It was gathered that the insurgents had launched attack on an army barrack in the area before they took over the town and embarked on a house to house raid.</p><p>The attack on Gamboru Ngala comes after <a href=#>the town was almost entirely destroyed in May during a devastating assault that also left more than 300 people killed and prompted outrage at the lack of military response.</a></p><p>A security service source had informed AFP that many residents in the area sought refuge across the border in the north Cameroon town of Fotokol.</p><p>The Islamist sect had seized Gwoza, Borno State, which is a base for a police college last Wednesday, killing scores of residents and forcing thousands others to flee to Mubi, in neighbouring Adamawa State, as refugees.</p><p>Nigeria Police said on Saturday that about<a href=#> 35 of its men who were on training during the attack are still missing</a>.</p><p>Boko Haram, which has been blamed for more than 10,000 deaths in a five-year-old uprising, has in recent weeks sought to <a href=#>take over a number of towns in Borno State</a>, shifting from hit-and-run tactics to an apparent holding strategy.</p><p>It would be recalled that <a href=#>Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, had in a video released on Sunday, 24 August, announced that the insurgents had turned the town of Gwoza and the surrounding countryside which the group had earlier seized into an <i>“Islamic Caliphate.”</i></a></p><p>Nigeria’s military dismissed Shekau’s claim as “empty”, maintaining that the country’s sovereignty remained intact.</p><p>But that assertion is in conflict with multiple reports indicating that Boko Haram controls several towns in Borno and at least one in neighbouring Yobe state.</p><p>Analysts believe that Boko Haram will attempt to hold more towns in Borno in the short to mid-term, with Nigeria’s military unable or unwilling to tackle them.</p><p>Some Nigerian troops stationed in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, have recently refused to be deployed to Gwoza because of what they say are sub-standard weapons that leave them at the mercy of the better-equipped rebels.</p><p>Defence analysts have also argued that Nigeria needs to improve its counter-insurgency strategy and adapt to guerrilla fighting rather than relying on conventional means.</p><p>Others complain of a lack of political will to properly tackle Boko Haram, which wants to establish a hardline Islamic state and whose campaign has targeted schools, churches and government installations.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3l8lnBwZpuRorKzu86nZKGnnJnAbrrIoJyroZGjerS7y52gnqqjY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danimilkman-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DaniMilkman -
