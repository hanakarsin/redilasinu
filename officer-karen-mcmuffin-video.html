But I'm on my way home from work, when I pull up to the window, they hand me my receipt so I go the second window to get my food."</p><p>"And I'm waiting, and I'm waiting, and I'm waiting, and so the girl comes to the window and asks me what my order was. I repeat my order, and they ask me to pull up because my food's not ready. It's an English muffin meal with a hash brown and coffee."</p><p>"And I mean, I hadn't eaten since probably ... like in a while, so I was kind of hungry. And I'm still waiting, and I'm still waiting, and they ask me to pull up. So I pull up and a girl comes out with my coffee, and just the coffee. And she hands it to me and I have my window down," Stacey states as her voice begins to crack.</p><p>"And that's all she hands me is the coffee. So I told her, don't bother with the food because right now I'm too nervous to take it. It doesn't matter how many hours I've been up, it doesn't matter what I've done for anyone, right now I'm too nervous to take a meal from McDonald's because I can't see it being made."</p><p>"I don't know what's going on with people nowadays, but please just give us a break, please just give us a break. I don't know how much more I can take. I've been in this for 15 years and I've never had such anxiety about waiting for McDonald's drive-thru food. So just have a heart, and if you see an officer, just tell them thank you because I don't hear thank you enough anymore. All I want is my McDonald's."</p><p>As you can imagine, the video attracted a fair bit of criticism online, with many calling the officer "Karen."&nbsp;</p><p>"Karen" is the blanket name given to middle-class white women who have been caught doing questionable things, particularly to Black people. In this past, this has included <a href=#><strong>coughing on other people</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>refusing to wear a mask</strong></a> while shopping, and <a href=#><strong>threatening to call the police</strong></a> on a Black bird watcher.</p><p>"The cops who killed Breonna Taylor have still not yet been charged," one user wrote.
